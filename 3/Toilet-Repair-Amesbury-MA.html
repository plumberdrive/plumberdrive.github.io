<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Amesbury MA</h3>
<p>Malfunctioning plumbing and components can be more than a nuisance: It can cost you cash in increased water bills and cause structural damage to your home. 10 percent of homes nationwide have leakages in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Fixing those leakages can save you 10 percent on your water expenses each year.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
