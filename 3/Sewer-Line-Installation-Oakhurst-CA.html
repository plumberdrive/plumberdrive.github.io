Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a stable and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You need to also check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
