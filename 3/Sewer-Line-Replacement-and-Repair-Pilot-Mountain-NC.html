<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Pilot Mountain NC</h3>
<p>Stegle Plumbing has taken on more than just the residential work, ending up several recent commercial tasks as well.A current commercial plumbing task as a subcontractor was a 3,500-square-foot structure for a church. Included in the task was an 800-square-foot commercial kitchen where Stegle's personnel installed a triple-compartment sink, a hand sink and commercial dishwasher. They also plumbed the ADA restrooms.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
