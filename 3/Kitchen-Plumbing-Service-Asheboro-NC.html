<p>The great news is that it does not always need a repair of your whole unit if you think your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is made up of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or repaired due to their regular use. When these parts wear out, they result in small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

With well water, these symptoms may also be paired with iron discolorations and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>
