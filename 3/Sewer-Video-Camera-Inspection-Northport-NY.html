<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
