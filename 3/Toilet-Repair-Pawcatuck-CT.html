<p>As a locally-owned business, stability and obligation are exceptionally crucial to developing a credibility for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean supply of water within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.
