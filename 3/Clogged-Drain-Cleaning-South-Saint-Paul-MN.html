<p>Before our professional service technicians can start applying their skills and experience, we initially need to make sure that the line is appropriately cleaned and gotten ready for our repair work. Our repair procedures rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections triggered by waste buildup can avoid the liner from adhering to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and provide a cautious cleaning.</p>
