<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.
