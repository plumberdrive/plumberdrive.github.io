<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your home. Even if the issue originates with the local system, it's still wise to generate the professionals to restrict the damage to your house.</p>
<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair professional knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
