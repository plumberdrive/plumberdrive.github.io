Prior to setting up, your professional will switch off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is attached to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
