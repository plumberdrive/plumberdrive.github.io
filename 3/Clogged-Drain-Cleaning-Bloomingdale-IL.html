<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent man. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as assured. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Faucets serve an useful function, and you desire one that reaches conveniently into the sink bowl, lessening the splash and spray that originate from an inadequately put, or too short, faucet arm.
