<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
