<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of materials utilized to develop a garbage disposal unit: aluminum and stainless steel.

Sewer pipes can be infamously hard to trace, particularly on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll wish to work with somebody who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>
