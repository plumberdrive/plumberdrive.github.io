When no other source of a leak can be identified, it is safe to presume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet. For this leak, you will want to unscrew the drain, and clean it completely. If it is set in place, get rid of all of the previous plumber's putty by using a scraper.</p>
