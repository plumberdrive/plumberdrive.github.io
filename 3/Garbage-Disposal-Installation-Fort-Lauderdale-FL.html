<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Fort Lauderdale FL</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
