<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than products containing severe chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
