<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each element. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
