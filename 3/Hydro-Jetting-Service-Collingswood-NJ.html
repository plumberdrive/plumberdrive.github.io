<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Collingswood NJ</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it too.</p>
