While it might look like a job worth taking on, there are numerous factors to avoid taking a Do It Yourself technique to a sewer line repair task and instead choose to work with a licensed, professional plumber.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

Call the maker to see whether your guarantee covers a complimentary replacement if you need to replace the sink or faucet.</p>
