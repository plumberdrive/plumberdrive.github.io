<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Dunn</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
