<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Dunn</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust.

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.
