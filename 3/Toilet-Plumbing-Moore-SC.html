When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
