<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to carry out website inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is required as an outcome of a potential or real cross-connection hazard on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are only carried out on Wednesdays. Area Repairs: Utilizing one or a combination of the above services, we will fix the problems we discover with the camera inspection directly without rooting out any more than we have to.</p>

Depending on the severity of the situation, just one piece might need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly needs to be removed and replaced.

Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, need to be reconfigured.</p>
