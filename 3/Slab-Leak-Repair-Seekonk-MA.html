Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
