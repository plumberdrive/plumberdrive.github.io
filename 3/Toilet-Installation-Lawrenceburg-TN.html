Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
