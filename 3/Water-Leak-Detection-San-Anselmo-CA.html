<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies San Anselmo CA</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
