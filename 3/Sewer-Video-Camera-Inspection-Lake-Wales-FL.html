<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Lake Wales FL</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>Since of the fundamental design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an incredibly low flow or static circulation condition may cause problem leaking and prospective fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
