<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a practical service, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
