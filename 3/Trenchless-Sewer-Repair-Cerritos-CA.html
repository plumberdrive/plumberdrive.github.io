<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of maintaining the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, likewise has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is another important element required to make the procedure work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
