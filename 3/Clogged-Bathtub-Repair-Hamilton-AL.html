<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Hamilton AL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in exceptionally uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a threat to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to arrange yearly inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you understand that you have a history of clogging or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to evaluate the backflow assembly. The tester will send the outcomes to us.
