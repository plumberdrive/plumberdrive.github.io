For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst.

We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
