AVB's can be plastic or brass and either manual or electrical. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are installed on each zone of the watering system, instantly after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
