<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The technician switched off the water system and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor.

The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge.

When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
