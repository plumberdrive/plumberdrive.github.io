For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain.
