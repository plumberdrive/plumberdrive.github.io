<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>You probably understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your sinks, showers, and bathtubs to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working appropriately that's really all you need to learn about them, but when something fails, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what type of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the know-how to detect an issue and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas hot water heater, electrical water heaters and tankless hot water heater. Gently flex the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Image 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a corroded overflow pipe, worn out flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the professionals at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and decrease squandered water.</p>
