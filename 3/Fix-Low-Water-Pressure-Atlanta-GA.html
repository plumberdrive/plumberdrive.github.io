From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the movement of water within your system, and prevent any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This makes sure that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems remains detached from clean" water.</p>
