<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Imagine living in a home with soft water-- a house where you do not have weird movies on your dishes or mirrors, can lather soap quickly, and don't need to fret about scaling on the inside or beyond your home appliances. Sounds great, does not it? What if we informed you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environmentally friendly water supply for houses, you can.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line avoids them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
