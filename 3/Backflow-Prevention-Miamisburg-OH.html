<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls too. Even tree roots can create severe drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the problem for normal home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to additional damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is occurring to your house.</p>
