<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
