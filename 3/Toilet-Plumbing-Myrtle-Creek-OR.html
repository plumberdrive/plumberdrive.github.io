You might be believing that it doesn't make sense to utilize a pipe that reacts with water as your house's main source of water transportation, and you would be correct.

Fortunately, there are a great deal of other piping options nowadays including copper.</p>

In drinkable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographical areas with destructive water impurities.</p>
