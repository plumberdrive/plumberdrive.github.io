<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a brand-new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.

And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
