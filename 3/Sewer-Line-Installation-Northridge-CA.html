Angie's List members who had actually brand-new disposals set up in 2013 reported a typical cost of about $230, with a range from about $210 to $255, not counting discounts some suppliers use members. This represents polyethylene piping. This plastic product is relatively long lasting and versatile and can endure fundamental temperature variations.

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
