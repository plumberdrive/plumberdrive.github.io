Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
