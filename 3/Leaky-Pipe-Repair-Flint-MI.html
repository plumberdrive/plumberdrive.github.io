Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
