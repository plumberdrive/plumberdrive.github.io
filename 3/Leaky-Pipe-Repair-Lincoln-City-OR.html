Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, including both water system and drain lines.

<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company provides consist of check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and reduced pressure zone assemblies. Pointer: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, eliminate the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to mounting the disposal. When you connect the P-trap, also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
