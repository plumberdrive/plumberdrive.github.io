<p>Very seldom does any structural damage take place as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is generally detected before it causes any considerable damage. The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This little hole permits water to continuously leak out really slowly. In time it can result in a significant construct of water.

<p>It typically represents rust and mineral buildup if you discover low water pressure or blemished water. As rust and minerals develop with time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure.

Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main water system system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
