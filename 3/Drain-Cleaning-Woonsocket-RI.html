<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
