If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting trip to the store.

You may be thinking that it does not make sense to use a pipe that responds with water as your home's main source of water transport, and you would be proper.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
