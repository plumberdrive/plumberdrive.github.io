<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Florence CO</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent reviews and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
