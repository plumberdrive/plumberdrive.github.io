<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
