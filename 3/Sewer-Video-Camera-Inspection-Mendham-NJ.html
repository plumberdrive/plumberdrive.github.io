<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are badly damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it.
