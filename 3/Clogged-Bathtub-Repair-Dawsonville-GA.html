<p>I have been impressed with your company and its individuals from the day your sales person strolled in here, through all service personel, and now. By the way, this is a great system. Our energy expenses are much lower then in the past, the air flow is practically undetectable, the air temp inside is even, the humidity contstant, and we have actually had no failures given that installation.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a concern when used in combating a fire. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about securing people's lives and to a lesser extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source offered to accomplish that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and may as a result indicate that the level of defense on the fire protection system might need to be increased to a high risk security level.</p>
