Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system.

Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
