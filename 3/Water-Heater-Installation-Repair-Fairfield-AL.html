<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
