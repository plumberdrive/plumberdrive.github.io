<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
