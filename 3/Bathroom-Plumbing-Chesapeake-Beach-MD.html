<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
