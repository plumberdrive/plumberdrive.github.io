<p>If you notice low water pressure or tarnished water, it generally represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
