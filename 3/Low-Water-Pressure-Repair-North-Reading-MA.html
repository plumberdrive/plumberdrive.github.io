<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections guarantee that water systems in buildings are connected properly, without any cross-connection to contaminate safe and clean water systems.

Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and decontaminated throughout regrowth. Lastly, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
