<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of piping that are used in the repiping procedure. Copper piping and PEX piping are utilized because of their safety, performance and cost. Copper piping avoids germs from growing within the pipe supplying healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both versatile and lightweight.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
