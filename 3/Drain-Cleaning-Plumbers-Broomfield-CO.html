<p>Many property owners think their energy companies or property owners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that in most cases you, the property owner, are responsible. Most basic homeowners insurance policies and local utility companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your home.</p>
