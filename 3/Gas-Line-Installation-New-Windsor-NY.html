<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
