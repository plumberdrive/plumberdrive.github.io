<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
