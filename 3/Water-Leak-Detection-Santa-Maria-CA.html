<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is a sudden decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire combating or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction result and draw possible contaminants into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are typically found in the majority of houses. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the leading to provide warm water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>

<p>Often brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Additionally, sometimes a defective fill valve might actuate periodically, as well. Water will not drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
