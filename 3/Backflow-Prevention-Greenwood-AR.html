<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in Greenwood Arkansas</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
