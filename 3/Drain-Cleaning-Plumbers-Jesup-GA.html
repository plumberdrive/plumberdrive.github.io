<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation set includes a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
