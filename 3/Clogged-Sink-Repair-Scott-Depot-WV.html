<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low.

Depending on your needs, you may need more than one tankless water heater to meet your day-to-day warm water demands.</p>
