<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
