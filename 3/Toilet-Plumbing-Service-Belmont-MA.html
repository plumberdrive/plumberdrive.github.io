<p>However, there is one DIY task that isn't basic and is best delegated the professionals: sewer line repair Sewer repairs can quickly become complex when managed by someone with little to no experience in plumbing. While it may appear like a task worth taking on, there are numerous reasons to avoid taking a Do It Yourself method to a sewer line repair job and instead choose to hire a licensed, professional plumber.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more.
