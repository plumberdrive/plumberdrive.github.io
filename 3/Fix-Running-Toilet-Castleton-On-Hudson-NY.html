<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
