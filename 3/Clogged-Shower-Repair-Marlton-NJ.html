<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit is available in 2 fundamental types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to operate the system. Continuous feed prevails and the most convenient to utilize; a batch feed design is safer but can be slower to use on big amounts of food waste since you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company provides an introduction of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hindering water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by conserving the amount of trash that gets sent to landfills and other dumping locations. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
