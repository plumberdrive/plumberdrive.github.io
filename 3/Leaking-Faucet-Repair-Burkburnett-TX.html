<p>Property owners can request a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is particularly prudent to arrange inspections on a yearly basis and when purchasing a new house. Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the sodium bicarbonate and vinegar mixture, an enzyme treatment will likewise keep pipes running efficiently. Enzymes are bacteria that feed on raw material, such as hair, mold, algae and other typical clog-causers. This natural option is reliable and safe. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to buy our suggested enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I've consulted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

A licensed professional can assist you identify if your building requires a backflow preventer or numerous gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very rare cases where the building is considered to not pose a danger to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>Strainers are suggested prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire battling water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
