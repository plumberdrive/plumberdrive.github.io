If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a timely way, the possibilities are high that it will cause extra damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification.
