<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Basically, soft water conserves you money. Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are effectively preserved. Making sure the salt water tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and help eliminate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
