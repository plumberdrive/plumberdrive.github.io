<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Port Washington NY</h3>
<p>Stegle Plumbing has taken on more than just the residential work, finishing several current commercial jobs as well.A current commercial plumbing job as a subcontractor was a 3,500-square-foot building for a church. Included in the job was an 800-square-foot commercial kitchen where Stegle's staff set up a triple-compartment sink, a hand sink and commercial dishwasher. They also plumbed the ADA restrooms.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
