<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
