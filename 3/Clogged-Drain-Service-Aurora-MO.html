<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank.

A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complicated concerns with water temperature or pressure might need changing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
<p>You might be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve cash.
