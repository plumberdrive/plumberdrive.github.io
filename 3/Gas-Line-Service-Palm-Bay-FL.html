<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>You need to invest at least $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a durable finish system. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be irritating. The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to use however requires occasional -ring replacement.</p>
