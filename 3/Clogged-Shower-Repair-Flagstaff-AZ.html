<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
