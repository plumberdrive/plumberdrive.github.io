If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you should wait till after the cycle is completed and after that examined the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should likewise examine to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
