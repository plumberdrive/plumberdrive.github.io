<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to first obtain the required authorization( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Authorization page for additional information on getting a permit. When you obtain an authorization you can commence with the work. However, you need to call for inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for up to 100 years.</p>
