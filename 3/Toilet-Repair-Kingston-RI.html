<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
