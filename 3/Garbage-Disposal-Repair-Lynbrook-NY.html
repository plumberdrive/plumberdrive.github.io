You may be thinking that it does not make good sense to use a pipe that responds with water as your home's main source of water transport, and you would be correct. However, when most of these pipes were being set up, no one knew this was going to be the outcome. Thankfully, there are a great deal of other piping options nowadays including copper.</p>
