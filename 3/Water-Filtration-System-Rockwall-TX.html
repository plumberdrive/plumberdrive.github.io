<p>Surface Area Accelerated Formation is a development that simulates biomineralization, the system commonly recognized for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to entirely get rid of momentary solidity in water.</p>

Water filtration systems get rid of these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are necessary requirements, not optional expenditures.
