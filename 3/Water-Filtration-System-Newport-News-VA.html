<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
