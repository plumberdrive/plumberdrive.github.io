<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
