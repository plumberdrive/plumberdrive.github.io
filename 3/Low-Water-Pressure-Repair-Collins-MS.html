<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, particularly when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
