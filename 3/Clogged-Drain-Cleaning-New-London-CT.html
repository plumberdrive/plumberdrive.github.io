<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
