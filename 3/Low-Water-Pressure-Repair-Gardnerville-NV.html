Picking a tank with a minimum of 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star score is suggested. The energy efficiency of a storage water heater is suggested by its Energy Factor (EF). The more effective the hot water heater the higher the EF rating. Nevertheless, just because a hot water heater has a higher EF worth, it doesn't always suggest it will have lower operating costs.

You may have to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
