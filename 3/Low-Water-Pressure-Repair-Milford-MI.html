<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water.

<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major offenders. They harden to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce serious drain clogs by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the issue for regular home plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it results in more damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
