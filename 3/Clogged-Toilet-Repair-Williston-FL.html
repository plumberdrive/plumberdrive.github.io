<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
