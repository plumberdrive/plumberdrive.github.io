If you smell a strong whiff of gas from your vehicle when it is running, you might have a gas leak from the fuel line. It is important to repair this immediately to avoid an explosion. It is best to take your car to a certified mechanic if you are not specific of your repair abilities.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing yearly forward flow tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them.

<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Photo 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
