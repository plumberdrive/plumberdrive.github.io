<p>Woodbury's water hardness is approximately 13.5 grains. Appropriate clean out access needed. Recommendations will be provided and performed at the estimated price upon homeowner approval. Legitimate at participating ARS ® Network locations. Not valid for 3rd party, brand-new building, or commercial customers, with any other offers, discount rates, or on previous sales. Call service center for information. Discount coupon required at time of service. Void if copied or moved and where prohibited. Any other use may make up fraud. Cash worth $.001.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
