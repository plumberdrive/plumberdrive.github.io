<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Katy TX</h3>
<p>All of us experience a clogged drain at some point. You can attempt to take matters into your hands by utilizing daily items, such as a plunger, a coat wall mount, or a snake. Some house owners will try to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, particularly if you are dealing with a little drain clog. However, they are generally temporary fixes that do not use irreversible resolutions.</p>
<p>If the sound of your toilet constantly running is normal to you, then you've got a problem with over-running or leaking. This water is being dumped down the overflow tube squandering up to 200 gallons of water daily. That takes a toll on your water bill, not to mention the threat of a more severe leak that could damage your house with flooding.</p>
