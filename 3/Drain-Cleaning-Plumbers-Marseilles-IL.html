<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people expect to see but seldom stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.

Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically funnelled elsewhere to a close-by treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in.
