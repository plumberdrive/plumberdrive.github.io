<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Marietta GA 30062</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
