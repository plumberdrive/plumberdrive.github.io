Hard water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Hard water likewise makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.

Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>If your house utilizes around 45 gallons of warm water every day, the on-demand gas heater can conserve as much as 35% of the energy needed for heated water. They can also decrease the energy needed for houses with far greater requirements also.
