<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

Depending on your needs, you may need more than one tankless water heater to meet your everyday hot water needs.</p>
