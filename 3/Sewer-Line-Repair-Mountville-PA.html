When a brand-new house is built, pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up properly and to local, state, and federal code.

The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
