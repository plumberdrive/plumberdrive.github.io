<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
