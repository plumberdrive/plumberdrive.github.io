<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
