<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
