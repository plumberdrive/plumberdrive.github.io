<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
