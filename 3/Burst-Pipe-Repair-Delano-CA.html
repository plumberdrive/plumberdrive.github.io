<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
