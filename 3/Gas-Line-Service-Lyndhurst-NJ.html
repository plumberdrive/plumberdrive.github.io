<p>All of us experience a clogged drain eventually. You can try to take matters into your hands by using daily products, such as a plunger, a coat hanger, or a snake. Some house owners will try to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, especially if you are dealing with a small drain clog. However, they are normally short-lived fixes that do not provide permanent resolutions.</p>
