<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
