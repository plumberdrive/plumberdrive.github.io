It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
