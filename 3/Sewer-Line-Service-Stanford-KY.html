<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily when water is hard. Water softening can avoid these negative results. Gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides gas an odor frequently connected with rotten eggs. This distinctive scent allows you to smell a potential leak if it occurs. If you think a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
