<p>The great news is that it does not necessarily require a repair of your whole system if you believe your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their regular usage. When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets should definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
