Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
