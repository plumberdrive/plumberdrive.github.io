<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid normally will help eliminate them. If you would like to try the gentlest method perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't do the trick then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to read the instructions and security cautions initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust stains and it's readily available at many hardware stores.</p>
