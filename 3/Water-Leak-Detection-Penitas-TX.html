Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system.

Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
