Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean water system within a structure these gadgets are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is installed.
