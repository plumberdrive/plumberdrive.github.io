<p>Use the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several houses in my community being repiped and have spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it starts with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause major damage if the leak isn't discovered quickly.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to definitely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>
