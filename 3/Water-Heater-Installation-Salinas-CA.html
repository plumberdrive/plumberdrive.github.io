<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Salinas CA</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>
