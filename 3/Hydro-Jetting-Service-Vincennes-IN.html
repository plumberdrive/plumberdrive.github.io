    <meta name="description" content="24 Hours Plumbing Vincennes Indiana - Inside our houses, the architects and homeowners of the late 19th century were as confused as the engineers about what to do. People had washstands in their bedrooms, so at first they just stuck sinks and taps into them, and put the toilet into whatever closet in the hall or space under the stairs that they could find, hence the water closet.” They quickly realised that it didn't make a lot of sense to run plumbing to every bedroom when it was cheaper to bring it all to one place, and the idea of the bathroom was born.">

It had to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes.
