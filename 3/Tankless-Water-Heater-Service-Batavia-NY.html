Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
