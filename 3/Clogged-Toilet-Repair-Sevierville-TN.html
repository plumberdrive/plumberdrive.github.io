<p>No hot water-- The lack of warm water is the biggest indication that there is something wrong with your San Antonio hot water heater. You may have sediment that has actually built up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting enough hot water for your shower. It's time to consult the professionals if your water heater isn't doing its only job.</p>
<h3>Tankless Water Heater in Sevierville Tennessee</h2>
<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
