<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly.
