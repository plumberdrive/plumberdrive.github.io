<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will establish.

<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
