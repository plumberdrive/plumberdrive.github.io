<p>To figure out if your house is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray).

<p>Although it might be appealing to gather non-prescription drain-clearing items, many plumbers recommend against it. Not only are the chemicals toxic if exposed to human skin, they might also damage drain pipes if overused. There are extra problems that may come up, which is why our experienced plumbers will perform a thorough inspection of your unit to determine what has caused it to malfunction. From there we can make an informed decision on whether your problem can be solved by a simple repair or if changing the waste disposal unit is ultimately the much better choice.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt since they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
