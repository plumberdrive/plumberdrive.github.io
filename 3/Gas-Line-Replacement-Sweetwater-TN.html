<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
