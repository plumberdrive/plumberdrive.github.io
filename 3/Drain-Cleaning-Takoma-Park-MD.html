The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.
