<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
