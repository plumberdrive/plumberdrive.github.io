<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts.

If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the part, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
