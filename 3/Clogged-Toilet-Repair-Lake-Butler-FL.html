It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.
