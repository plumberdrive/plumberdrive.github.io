<p>Very first consider your options if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak. A complete sewer pipe replacement might not be required. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better choice. If your sewer lines are below trees, near comprehensive landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can trigger a lot of collateral damage (and cost) to the surrounding area.</p>

If this is what is taking place to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it causes further damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
