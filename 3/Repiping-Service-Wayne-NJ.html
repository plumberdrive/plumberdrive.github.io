Many scattering systems currently have the appropriate backflow preventer set up and need just be tested every year. Others may not fulfill state and local regulations and may need to be changed with the proper backflow preventer.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This typical lifespan estimation presumes typical wear and tear of the system.
