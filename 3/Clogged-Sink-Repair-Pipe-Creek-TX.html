<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but rarely stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
