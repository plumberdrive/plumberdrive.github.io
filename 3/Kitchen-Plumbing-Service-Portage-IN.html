<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use a growing number of detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized throughout regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
