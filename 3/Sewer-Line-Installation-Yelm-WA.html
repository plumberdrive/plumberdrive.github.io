<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
