<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>

All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to repair the drain and identify problem. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is especially beneficial in finding an issue.</p>
