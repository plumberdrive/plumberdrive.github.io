<p>It is estimated that the typical individual spends over 3 years of their life resting on the toilet, and many bathroom readers are at risk of ending up being permanently attached to the fixture. Which is why picking a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is exceptionally crucial. However, you have to make sure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't an excellent concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically created to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't distribute your weight uniformly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
