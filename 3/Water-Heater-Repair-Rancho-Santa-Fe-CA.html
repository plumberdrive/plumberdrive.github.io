<p>Keep in mind that repiping a house is a significant plumbing repair, and you should only employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch moisture so that it doesn't get in the control system. Although little pieces of sediment might survive a drip leg.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey stated that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are particular contaminants that residents are dealing with and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be fixed with the ideal RO system.</p>
