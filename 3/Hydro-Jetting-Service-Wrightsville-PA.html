<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
