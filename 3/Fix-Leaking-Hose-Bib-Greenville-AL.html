<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
