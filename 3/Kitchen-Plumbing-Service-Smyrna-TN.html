<p>Particles such as foreign objects - Objects such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can end up being trapped in between your drainpipe and your pipes.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Water softeners will go to drain throughout backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending on the size of the unit). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of solidity minerals and chloride that you may not want just running outside. Not to discuss plumbing code might be violated without appropriate backflow prevention.</p>
