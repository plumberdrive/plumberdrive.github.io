<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
