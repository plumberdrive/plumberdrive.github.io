<h3>Leak Repair in Port Neches Texas</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
