Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
