These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of materials utilized to build a waste disposal unit unit: aluminum and stainless-steel. The typical cost of an aluminum garbage disposal ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel garbage disposal has a typical cost of simply over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously difficult to trace, particularly on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll want to work with somebody who will trace the issue at its source.</p>
