<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indicator of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken. It is necessary that you call a certified plumber if there is a persistent sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is very hazardous and can present major health threats.</p>
<p>It's difficult to determine if you have broken or broken drains till a video inspection is performed. Cracked or broken drains are usually preceded by repeating blockages, consistent nasty drain smells or the presence of sewer flies. The primary step is attempt to clear the blocked drain and after that right away inspect the drain. In some cases a smoke test can be performed to reveal cracks or breaks. ZOOM DRAIN performs a totally free peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
