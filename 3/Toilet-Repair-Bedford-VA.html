<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
