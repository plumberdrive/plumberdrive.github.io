<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
