<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more vulnerable and brittle to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are prone to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Particular pipe products have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and stress as an outcome of temperature level change and ice development. And these differences dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
