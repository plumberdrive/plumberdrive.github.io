<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the make-up water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Prospective impurities can then enter the safe and clean water supply. The very best way to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: On average, changing a gas or electric water tank with a comparable design takes two to three hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old water heater. Placing the brand-new unit takes roughly thirty minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to protect the new connection points and verify that all functions depend on code.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix.
