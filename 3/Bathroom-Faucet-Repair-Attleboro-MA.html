<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are seriously damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
