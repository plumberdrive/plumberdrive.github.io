The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
