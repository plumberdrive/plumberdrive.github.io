Throughout regeneration, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
