<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you choose must be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted should have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
