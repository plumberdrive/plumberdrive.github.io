<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is usually identified prior to it causes any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This little hole allows water to constantly leak out very gradually. Gradually it can result in a substantial build of water. Leaked water generally remains under your home and fills into the ground soil. This can potentially cause a cavity if your house's structure was not correctly compressed. This is a rare occasion and in basic, there is little issue over structural damage as the result of a slab leak.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
