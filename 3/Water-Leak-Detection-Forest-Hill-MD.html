<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in structures are connected appropriately, without any cross-connection to pollute safe and clean water systems. Fixtures need to be correctly trapped, to avoid sewer gas from getting away into a buildings. Warm water heaters are also checked to ensure that they have been installed properly, to prevent a surge.</p>
