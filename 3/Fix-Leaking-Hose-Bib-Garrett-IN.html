<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually restore after many gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
