<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
