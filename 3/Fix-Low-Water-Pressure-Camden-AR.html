Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating deterioration Co2 will possibly contribute to the development of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
