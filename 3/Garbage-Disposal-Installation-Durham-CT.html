<p>Sewer lines have one important function: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Most folks replace their water heaters due to poor efficiency, total failure or as a preventive procedure. If your water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to think about changing it with a more effective model. Water on the floor can mean used parts.

Compared to the everyday expenditures and aggravations sustained by tough water, a water softener is eventually a financial investment that will conserve you a significant amount of money.
