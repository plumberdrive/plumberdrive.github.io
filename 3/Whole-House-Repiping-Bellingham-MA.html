<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is easy and cheap. However finding the right washer may not be. The most typical washers are often readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to discover. If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
