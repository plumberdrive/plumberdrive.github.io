<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
