<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electromagnetic gadgets can be reliable in avoiding scale development in tough water systems. It is really challenging to judge such claims, which are almost never based on tests that are well enough described to enable others to evaluate them and to validate the results. While the lack of "clinical" evidence does not in itself revoke a claim for the efficacy of a device, it should make one hesitate to accept it without some guarantee of performance.</p>

When a new home is developed, pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up properly and to local, state, and federal code.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
