<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
