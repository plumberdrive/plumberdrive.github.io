<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pressed against it will lead to decapitation, it might terrify a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
<p>It's a good concept to set up annual inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you understand that you have a history of leaking or blocking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to evaluate the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the results to us.
