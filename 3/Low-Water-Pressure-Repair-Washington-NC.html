Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>If it slowly drains away as you work, add more hot water. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to try a brand-new approach.

It's so old that it is no longer able to press water through the toilet to totally clear the drain. This leads to your toilet having a constant blocking issue.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Among the things we focus on is the bathroom toilet. Many individuals and companies let the toilet drainage year after year with leaking or ineffective designs. This is money and a natural resource running down the drain. Water conservation in the desert is very important and older toilets can use 3.5 gallons of water per flush! Our master technicians will be able to bring back or replace the toilet the same day most of the times saving you time and money.</p>
