<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation.

When you connect the P-trap, likewise attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
<p>There are two main types of backflow systems: air gap (AG) and reduced pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that everyone utilizes around 80-100 gallons of water a day.
