<p>You are accountable for replacing the assembly or fixing within 30 days if your assembly stops working the annual test. All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate kind of assembly based on the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly needs to satisfy the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be ceased until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention.
