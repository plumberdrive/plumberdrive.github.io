<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Gas line repair can not be held off. A gas line leak is potentially dangerous and needs to be resolved rapidly. Additionally, this repair work needs that you employ a licensed plumber It is imperative that gas work, installation, refitting and all other aspects are done by certified professional plumbing contractors.
