<p>Think about all the areas water streams in and out of your house. These are the areas that a professional evaluation must cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other appliances. Even your water lines must be covered.

After all, excessive pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with inefficient water devices.</p>

<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Although it might be tempting to pour in non-prescription drain-clearing items, lots of plumbers encourage versus it. Not only are the chemicals poisonous if exposed to human skin, they may also damage drain pipes if excessive used.

From there we can make a notified decision on whether your issue can be resolved by an easy repair or if replacing the garbage disposal is eventually the much better option.</p>
