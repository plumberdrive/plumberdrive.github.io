Throughout regrowth, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the exterior of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a possible concern with the water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can likewise suggest the water heater is near the end of its life.
