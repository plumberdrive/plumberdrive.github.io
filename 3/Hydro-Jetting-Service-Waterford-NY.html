He noted that there are certain impurities that homeowners are handling and an RO can assist reduce those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.

<p>Idea: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and inspect the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you notice water coming back in your sink or shower?

When the water is really tough and it is utilized greatly, the expenses of softening will increase.</p>
