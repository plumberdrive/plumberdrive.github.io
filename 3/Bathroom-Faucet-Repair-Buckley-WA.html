<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Pointer: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and examine the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you observe water coming back in your sink or shower? This could suggest that the water doesn't have a clear path to do through, more than likely because of a blocked drain. This is likewise the best time to add the cord and plug to your disposal.
