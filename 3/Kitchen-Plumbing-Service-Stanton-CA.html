<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
