<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

The water in your sink, shower, or toilet drains slowly - This is the most common sign that you've got a drain stoppage. While slow draining pipes indicates the drain isn't totally clogged, there's still sufficient buildup inside it to stop water and waste from going down easy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner.

If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
