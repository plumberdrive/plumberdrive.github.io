<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
