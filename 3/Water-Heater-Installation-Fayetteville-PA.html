<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
