<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you don't get that chance.

With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>

A lot of other types of leaky kitchen sinks which are annoying but are usually fixed easily.

<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
