We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than items containing harsh chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or components.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
