<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable solution, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>
