Check for damages and holes if your tank is relatively new and you have this problem. Assess your backyard for any invasive tree roots.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly.

It's called Hybrid Water Heating. A Hybrid Water Heater pushes cold water from the bottom up through a series of radiating transfer pipes. It's makes the most of energy efficiently by pressing the heat in different directions, and recycles the energy created numerous times.
