<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
<h3>Drain Jetting in Pittsboro North Carolina</h2>
<p>Particles such as foreign objects - Objects such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can end up being trapped between your drainpipe and your pipes.

Tip: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, get rid of the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before installing the disposal. Also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
