Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
