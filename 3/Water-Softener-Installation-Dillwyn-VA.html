<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
