<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably easy system, regardless of their importance. Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your organisation, where irrigation satisfies the main water system. From here, the preventer can keep track of the movement of water within your system, and avoid any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment. This guarantees that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems stays detached from clean" water.</p>
