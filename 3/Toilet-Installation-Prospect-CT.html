A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you receive an exemption.

<p>Broken pipes end up being incredibly more pricey to fix as the rate of the circulation of the broken pipe grows.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper preventative measures if using one of these items.</p>
