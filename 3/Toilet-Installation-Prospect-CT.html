<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a risk to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

<p>Broken pipes end up being incredibly more pricey to fix as the rate of the circulation of the broken pipe grows.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper preventative measures if using one of these items.</p>
