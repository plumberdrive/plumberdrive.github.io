<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>When set up, these BPAs go through regular and preliminary testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued functional efficiency. Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester registered with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific details is also available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi).
