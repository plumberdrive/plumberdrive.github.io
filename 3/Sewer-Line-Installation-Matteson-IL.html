<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the dead giveaways of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with a substandard plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
