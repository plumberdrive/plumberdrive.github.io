<p>It is approximated that the average individual spends over 3 years of their life sitting on the toilet, and many bathroom readers are at risk of ending up being permanently attached to the fixture. Which is why selecting a comfy, well-made toilet seat is extremely crucial. However, you need to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort.
