Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
