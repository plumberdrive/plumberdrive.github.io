<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair service technician understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer needs numerous items to be examined. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be examined. The installation needs to be evaluated to guarantee it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test information must be accumulated to identify the workings of each component. The backflow prevention assembly should be disassembled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be evaluated again to be sure it was properly repaired. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow diagram is needed to guarantee it was fixed correctly. An effectively fixed assembly ought to offer years of protection.</p>
