<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
