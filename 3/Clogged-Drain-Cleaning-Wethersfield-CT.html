Difficult water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
