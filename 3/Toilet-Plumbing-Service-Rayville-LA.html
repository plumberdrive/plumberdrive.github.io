Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly.

A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
