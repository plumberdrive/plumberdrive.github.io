<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To keep your safety, health, and house comfort, we use just the very best piping: polyethylene. Numerous homes and organisations utilize galvanized pipes for water circulation, which tend to degrade and can adversely impact our health. Copper is also commonly utilized because of its durability and safer construction, however polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the marketplace and guarantees the healthiest and cleanest water flow.</p>
