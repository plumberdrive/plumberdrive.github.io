<p>You reside in an older house. There's an excellent chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old.

This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
