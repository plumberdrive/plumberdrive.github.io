<p>You reside in an older house. There's an excellent chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>

Instead, a garbage disposal includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
