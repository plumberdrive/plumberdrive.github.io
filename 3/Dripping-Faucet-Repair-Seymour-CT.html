<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
