Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
