<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to wear away and burst when they get old.
