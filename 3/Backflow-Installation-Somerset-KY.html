Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.
