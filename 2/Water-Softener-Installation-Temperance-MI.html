<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
