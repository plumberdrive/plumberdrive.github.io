<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off.

Make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
