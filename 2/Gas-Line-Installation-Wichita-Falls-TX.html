<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual circulation, color, taste or smell. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complex issues with water temperature level or pressure may need replacing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>Rusting and rust on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a potential concern with the hot water heater.
