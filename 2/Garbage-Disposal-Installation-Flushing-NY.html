<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
