<p>It's an excellent concept to have a professional evaluate your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a couple of times. A drain professional like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system.

<p>We concentrate on entire home re-pipes, brand-new plumbing setups, and mainline water service replacement. Whether you require aid with a small repair, a re-pipe or a remodel, you can make sure that the work will be completed the very first time accurately. Low water pressure might be due to a plethora of aspects, but the most typical reasons are sediment accumulation and corrosion, which both block water from travelling through the entire pipe and put unnecessary pressure on specific areas of pipe.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line obstructions are not something a property owner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain technician to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to repair the drain and determine problem. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is particularly useful in locating an issue.</p>
