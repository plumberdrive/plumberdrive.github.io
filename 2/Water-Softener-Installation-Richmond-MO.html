<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Richmond MO</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a danger to the supply of water, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
