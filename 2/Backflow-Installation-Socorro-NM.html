<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when used in fighting a fire. Firefighters by and large are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are interesting in protecting individuals's lives and to a lower degree their property. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source available to accomplish that objective. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as a result indicate that the level of protection on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high danger protection level.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to take a look at. If your toilet is fairly new, you might need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing details. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in an option and is used to reveal the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will possibly add to the formation of carbonic acid, thus making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
