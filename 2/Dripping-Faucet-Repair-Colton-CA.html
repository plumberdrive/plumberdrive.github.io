Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
