<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you'll need to count on a trusted plumber to advise you whether it's time for a pipe replacement.

<p>Numerous house owners think their utility companies or house owners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that oftentimes you, the property owner, are responsible.
