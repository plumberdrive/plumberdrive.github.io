<p>Many toilet problems, consisting of leaking toilets, do not require repairing the whole toilet. Like any house device, a toilet tank features numerous little moving parts that may need changed with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and cause toilet leaks that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
