<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see however rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck.

Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>In many cases, a gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. This kind of circumstance might occur if a contractor is working on a person's landscaping and unintentionally burst a line.
