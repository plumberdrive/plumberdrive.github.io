<p>These people were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it as well.</p>
