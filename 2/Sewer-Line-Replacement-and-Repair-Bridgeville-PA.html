It can also indicate the water heater is near the end of its life if it is more than 6 or 7 years old. With heavy corrosion buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could mean that there have actually been variations in pressure triggering small leaks.</p>

Merely fill the pitcher with tap water and enable it to work through the filter. Then, it's ready to enjoy and consume. You can also opt to install a water filter on your sink faucet. This will filter the water and enhance its taste, while also minimizing smell. Faucet filtration systems are low-cost and simple to install, with lots of models boasting one click" installation.</p>
