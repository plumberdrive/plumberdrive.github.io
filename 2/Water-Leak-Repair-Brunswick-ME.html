<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

As time moves on, the zinc erodes, exposing the steel.</p>
