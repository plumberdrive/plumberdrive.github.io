<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water supply and personal on-site water supply and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between safe and clean (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches offer an increased level of defense for the public water supply system.</p>
<p>A lot of softeners have a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to supply some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's smart to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to preserve the system.</p>
