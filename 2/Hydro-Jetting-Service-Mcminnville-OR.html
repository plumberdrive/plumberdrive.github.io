<p>Family owned and operated considering that 2003, RT Plumbing Services delivers industry-leading plumbing knowledge, house redesigning service, and water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX community. Prior to setting up, your professional will turn off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its install.
