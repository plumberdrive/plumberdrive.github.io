Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
