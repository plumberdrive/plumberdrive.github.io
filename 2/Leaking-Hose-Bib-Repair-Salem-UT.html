<p>The most efficient way to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Electrical Breakdowns: Modern hot water heater likewise count on electrical components. You might be left with no hot water if something inside the unit stops working The discharge line is pressurized and can run some distance. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain?
