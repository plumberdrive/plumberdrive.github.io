<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
