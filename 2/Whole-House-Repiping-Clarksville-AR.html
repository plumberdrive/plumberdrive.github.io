Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
