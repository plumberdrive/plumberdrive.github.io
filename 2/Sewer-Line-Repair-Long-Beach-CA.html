<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
