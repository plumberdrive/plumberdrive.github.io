Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
