<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is fairly short. Soft or crisp foods are great, however difficult or stringy foods can be problem. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties. While some older houses might not have backflow preventers, all more recent properties are needed to have them. If you're unsure what kind of backflow preventers are used in your house or service, Doug's can help you locate and recognize them. We can also perform your annual backflow inspections.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
