<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank.

A plumbing professional can figure out whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complicated problems with water temperature or pressure might require changing the water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
