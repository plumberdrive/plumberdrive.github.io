<h3>Hot Water Heater Leaking in Orono Maine</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
