If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a likelihood that the storm drain is clogged and therefore needs to be cleared out. If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a timely way, the possibilities are high that it will trigger extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
