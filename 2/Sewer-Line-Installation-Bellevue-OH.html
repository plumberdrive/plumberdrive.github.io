Water softeners typically utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from dissolved sodium chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>

Sewer pipes can be infamously hard to trace, particularly on older properties, so you'll want to employ somebody who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A number of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
