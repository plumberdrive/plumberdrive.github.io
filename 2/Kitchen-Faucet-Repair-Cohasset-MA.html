<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Your expenses also will include your plumber's charge for eliminating your old disposal and linking the new one. The majority of plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that turn up will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site may affect the time it takes. These types of heaters can result in a substantial amount of contamination since carbon monoxide gets launched into the air while burning gas.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. If it remains in a garage and a little sluggish leak, schedule a quote as quickly as possible and guarantee absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
