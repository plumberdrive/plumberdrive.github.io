<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
