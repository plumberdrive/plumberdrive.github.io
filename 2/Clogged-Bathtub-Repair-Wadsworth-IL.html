<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that functions as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regrow after many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
