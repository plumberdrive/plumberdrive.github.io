Auto-reverse setting: Some waste disposal unit feature this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This protects the blades so they do not wear as quickly.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.
