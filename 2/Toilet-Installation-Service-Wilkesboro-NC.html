<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. Initially, plans for each device to be set up need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may take up to three weeks or more to authorize and process. Turned down plans need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
