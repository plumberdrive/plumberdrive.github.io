<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
