<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or take out a toilet. This is usually more labor-intensive and might need extra expenses. This is likewise not as effective due to the fact that the drain machine loses torque the even more you are far from the clog.
