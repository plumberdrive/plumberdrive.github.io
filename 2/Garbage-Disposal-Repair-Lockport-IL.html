<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Lockport IL</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
