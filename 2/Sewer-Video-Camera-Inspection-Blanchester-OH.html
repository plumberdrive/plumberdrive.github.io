<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned organisation, stability and obligation are incredibly essential to developing a credibility for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water system within a structure these devices are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you may face. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Check even though it may be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>
