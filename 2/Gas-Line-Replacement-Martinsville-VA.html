Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
