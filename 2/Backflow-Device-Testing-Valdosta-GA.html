<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
