<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a waste disposal unit is just geared up to deal with softer organic waste. If bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal, it might trigger it to jam and not work effectively. By running hot water through the disposal, you might have the ability to clear the clog yourself. However you risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
