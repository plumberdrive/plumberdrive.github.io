<p>You are accountable for changing the assembly or fixing within 30 days if your assembly stops working the yearly test. All replacements should be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right type of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Moreover, the assembly needs to fulfill the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be stopped until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Turn the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

They were fantastic at fixing the clogged drain, but very extremely careless about fixing the chip in the sink and using puddy under the sink.</p>
