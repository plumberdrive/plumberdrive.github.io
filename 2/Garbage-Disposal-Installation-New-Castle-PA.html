<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient working a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure.

Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
