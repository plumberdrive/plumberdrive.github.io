It is one of the most typical displays installed in the community and fits most consumer requirements. However, we more than happy to discuss what you hope to get from a disposal and guarantee that we supply the best solution.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.
