<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the appropriate safety measures if utilizing one of these items.</p>
