<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
