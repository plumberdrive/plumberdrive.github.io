<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas.

<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that chance.

With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
