<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
