<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
