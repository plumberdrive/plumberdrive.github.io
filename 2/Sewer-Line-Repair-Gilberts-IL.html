<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job since of the age of your home and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
