For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or actual connection between the general public water system and a source of contamination or contamination) can permit impurities or toxins to get in the drinkable water system. Sickness can arise from consuming water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company offers consist of double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and lowered pressure zone assemblies. Idea: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, eliminate the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to installing the disposal.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
