<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these negative impacts. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas an odor often related to rotten eggs. This distinctive scent allows you to smell a possible leak if it occurs. If you believe a leak, always leave.</p>
