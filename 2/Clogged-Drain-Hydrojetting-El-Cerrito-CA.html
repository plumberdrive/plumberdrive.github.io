<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
