<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical service, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
