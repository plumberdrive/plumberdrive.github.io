<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Pieces that consist of kitchen sink drains can become used and corroded, resulting in leakages. Depending upon the seriousness of the circumstance, just one piece might need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly must be gotten rid of and changed. Parts involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Incorrectly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, need to be reconfigured.</p>
