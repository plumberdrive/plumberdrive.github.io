<p>You are accountable for replacing the assembly or repairing within 30 days if your assembly fails the yearly test. All replacements need to be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right type of assembly based upon the conditions on your property (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly needs to fulfill the lead totally free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be stopped up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>

The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.

Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
