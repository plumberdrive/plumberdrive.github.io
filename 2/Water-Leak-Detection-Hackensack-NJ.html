<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
