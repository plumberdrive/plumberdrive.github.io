<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

When developed this way it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water system.

<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be completed. Initially, plans for each device to be installed should be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to three weeks or more to process and authorize. Declined plans should be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can include another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>

This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome suggest that the level of security on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high risk protection level.</p>
