<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Middletown OH</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very rare cases where the building is deemed to not position a threat to the supply of water, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
