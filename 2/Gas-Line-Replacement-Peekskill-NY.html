<p>Check the home's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a family of 4 should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and offered for use.
