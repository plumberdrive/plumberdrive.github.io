Water pressure might fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
