<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically restore after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
