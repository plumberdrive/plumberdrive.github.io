Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
