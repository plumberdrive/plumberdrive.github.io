<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and easy. However discovering the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
