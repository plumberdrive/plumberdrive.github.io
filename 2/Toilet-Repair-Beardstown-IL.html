<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause deterioration that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
