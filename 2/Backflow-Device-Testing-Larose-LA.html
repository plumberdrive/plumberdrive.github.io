<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
