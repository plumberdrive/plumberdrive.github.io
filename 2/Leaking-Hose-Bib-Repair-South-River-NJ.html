<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>This is incredibly crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to press the waste out of your drain system. Current regulations restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines.
