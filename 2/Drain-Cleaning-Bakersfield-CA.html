<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Bakersfield CA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your house or organisation, and its ability to function is essential. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be an indication of a larger problem, like a tree root invasion or a large clog. If the drains clog occasionally but you can typically flush them out, this might be a smaller sized clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Little obstructions can become huge ones fairly quickly.</p>
