<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Reidsville NC</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
