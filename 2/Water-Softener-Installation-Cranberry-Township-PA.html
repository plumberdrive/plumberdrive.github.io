<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and after that go back to service. Because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
