<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
