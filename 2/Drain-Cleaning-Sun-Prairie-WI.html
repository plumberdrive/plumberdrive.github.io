<p>The standard water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use. Unlike residential swimming pools, public or community swimming pools must utilize just RP devices or Air Gaps on their refill lines.

<p>The types of backflow preventers the company offers consist of double check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel models), and decreased pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, get rid of the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to mounting the disposal. When you attach the P-trap, also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>

Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
