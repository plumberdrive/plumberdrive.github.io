<p>Water firmness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

And that's where the term firmness" came from ... it's tough to wash in.</p>

<p>The calcium from limestone is the major factor to the firmness of Woodbury's water. Firmness can appear as a problem when water is boiled or dried from a drip due to the fact that it forms a white powder residue when all the water evaporates.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
