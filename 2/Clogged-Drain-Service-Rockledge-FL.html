<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, color, smell or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature or pressure might need replacing the water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is manually controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor.
