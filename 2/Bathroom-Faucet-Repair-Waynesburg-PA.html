<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair in Waynesburg Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
