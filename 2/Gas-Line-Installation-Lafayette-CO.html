<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
