<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; extra, more considerable expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for locals. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
