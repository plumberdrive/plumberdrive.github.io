<p>The most reliable method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are effectively preserved.

Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners enhance the regrowth cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
