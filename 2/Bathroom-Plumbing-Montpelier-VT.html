<p>Bear in mind that a disposal is not like the lots of basic house improvement projects around your home. It involves blades, a mix of electric work, and plumbing which then implies a mix of electricity and water. Accidents involving garbage disposals are too common to put yourself at risk. Considering the life span of a disposal, it would also be unnecessarily expensive to acquire all the tools and materials needed for the job.
