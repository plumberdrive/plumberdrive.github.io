The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
