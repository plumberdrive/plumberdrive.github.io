<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible option, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
