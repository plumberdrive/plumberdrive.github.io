<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
