For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to stream backward into city water supplies.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is used to express the intensity of the level of acidity of a service.

Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating rust Co2 will potentially add to the formation of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
