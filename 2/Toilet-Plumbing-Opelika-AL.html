<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Opelika AL</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
