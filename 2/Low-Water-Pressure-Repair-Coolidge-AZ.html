<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
