<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Holbrook MA 02343</h3>
<p>If you've always lived in an area with difficult water, you may not realize just how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to utilize more. Tough water likewise makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>

You can combat tough water in different methods, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
