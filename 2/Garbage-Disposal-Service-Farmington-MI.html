<p>When it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house, this is one of the first and main questions that you need to ask yourself. The age of your home is an important element to understand whether or not you need to repipe your house.

If your home was constructed prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you hire a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your home might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimal rates if your home was developed decades prior to that.</p>
