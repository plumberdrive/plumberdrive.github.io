<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
