<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
