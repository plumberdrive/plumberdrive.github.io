Non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not appropriately safeguarded.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when utilized in combating a fire. Firefighters by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are interesting in safeguarding people's lives and to a lower level their residential or commercial property. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source offered to accomplish that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome mean that the level of protection on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high hazard protection level.</p>
