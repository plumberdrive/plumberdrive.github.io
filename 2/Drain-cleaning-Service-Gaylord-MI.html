<h3>Toilet Drain in Gaylord Michigan</h2>
<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
