<p>Aside from these two essential elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
