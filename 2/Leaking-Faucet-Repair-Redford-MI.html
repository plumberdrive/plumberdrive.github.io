<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the significant culprits. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the problem for regular house plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your house, you need your drain cleaned up before it causes further damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
