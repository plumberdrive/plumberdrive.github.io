<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there ought to be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you should most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
