<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to initially acquire the needed permit( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our Authorization page for more details on getting an authorization. As soon as you get an authorization you can commence with the work. Nevertheless, you must require inspection before you cover or conceal any work.</p>
