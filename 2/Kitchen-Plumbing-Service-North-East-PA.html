<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>

<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your new disposal.
