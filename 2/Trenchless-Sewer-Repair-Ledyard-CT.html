<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low.
