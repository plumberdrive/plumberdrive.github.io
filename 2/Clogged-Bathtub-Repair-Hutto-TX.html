<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply.

Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
