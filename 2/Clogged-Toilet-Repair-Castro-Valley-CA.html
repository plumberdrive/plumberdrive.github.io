The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores.

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more reliable at getting rid of obstructions. Many homes have drain cleanouts, nevertheless, we encounter older houses without cleanouts.
