<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they remain in one place for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
