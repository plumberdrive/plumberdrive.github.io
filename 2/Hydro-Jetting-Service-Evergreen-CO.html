<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
