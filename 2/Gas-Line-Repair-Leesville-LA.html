<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
