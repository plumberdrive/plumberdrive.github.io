<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood East Alton IL</h3>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it gets in the home near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is connected to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Was your house built prior to the 1970s and has not undergone improvement or pipe replacement? If so, it is most likely that your pipes are made from galvanized metal or another product which has actually worn away and rotted over the years. Older pipes can cause major leaks and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes won't last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
