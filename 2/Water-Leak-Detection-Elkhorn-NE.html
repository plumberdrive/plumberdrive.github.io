<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.
