<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw.
