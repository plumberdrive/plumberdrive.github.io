<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use increasingly more cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and decontaminated during regeneration. Finally, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
