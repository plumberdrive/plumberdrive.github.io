Action 6: If there are no leaks, or when any leaks have been remedied, the drywall is replaced. Trenching expenses between $4 and $12 per direct foot depending on the depth. The service provider should get a permit prior to trenching. How frequently a backflow preventer needs to be tested depends on its type.

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that enables a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
