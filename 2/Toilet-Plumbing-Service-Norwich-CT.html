<h3>Heating, Cooling, Electrical And Plumbing Services Norwich CT</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>
