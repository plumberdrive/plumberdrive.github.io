<p>Having your plumbing regularly assessed is a key element of preventative maintenance. Nevertheless, lots of homeowners and business owners have an out of sight, out of mind" approach to plumbing and do not examine their pipes until there is a pushing concern. Regrettably, this approach allows leaks, tears, and other problems to go undetected, permitting them to become worse and even worse as time goes on.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>If you discover low water pressure or tarnished water, it normally signifies rust and mineral buildup.
