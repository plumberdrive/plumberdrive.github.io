<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair professional understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
