<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
