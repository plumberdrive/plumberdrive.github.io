<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

You can install brand-new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, many times in concrete.
