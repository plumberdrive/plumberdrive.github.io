This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
