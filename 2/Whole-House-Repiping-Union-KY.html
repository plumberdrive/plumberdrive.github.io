<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you must first acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our License page to find out more on obtaining an authorization. Once you get a license you can begin with the work. However, you should require inspection before you cover or conceal any work.</p>
<p>Typically, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by inexperienced or less comprehensive plumbers. So, you'll notice the exact same problems cropping up again and again, even though you have actually had them repaired.

From there we can make an informed choice on whether your issue can be fixed by an easy repair or if changing the waste disposal unit is ultimately the much better alternative.</p>
