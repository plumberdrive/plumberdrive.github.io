<p>Some house owners might think about water softeners as a luxury product, something that's nice to have" but not entirely necessary. However, tough water can cause everything from minor annoyances, like spots on dishes or soap scum, to significant problems like a shorter life expectancy for your water heater, dishwasher, and other important home devices. For these reasons and others, a water softener can be an useful financial investment for your house.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white spots on your dishes that won't disappear, white shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a persistent layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll be happy to understand that water softening can get rid of these problems and more. Hard water triggers these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to worry about any problems with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes tasks easier and less frustrating for everyone involved.</p>
