<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Sparta NJ</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating properly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality.
