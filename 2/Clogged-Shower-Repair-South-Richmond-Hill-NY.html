<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
