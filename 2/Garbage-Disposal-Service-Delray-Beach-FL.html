<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. Gradually, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials collect in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them tough to get rid of. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are one of the most typical indications that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, especially if they are triggering significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>

It might trigger it to jam and not work correctly if bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal. By running hot water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
