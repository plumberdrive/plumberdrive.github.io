<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
