<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
