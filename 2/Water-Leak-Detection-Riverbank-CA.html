<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
