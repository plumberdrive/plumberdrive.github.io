<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Fletcher NC</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may be or stop working lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
