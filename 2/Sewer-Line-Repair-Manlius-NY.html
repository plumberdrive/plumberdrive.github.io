<p>Buy a borax replacement water softer in the EU and it's tremendously most likely you will be acquiring a box of salt sesquicarbonate - Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2 WATER. Salt sesquicarbonate is a hydrated crystal comprised from salt carbonate and salt bicarbonate and is really frequently discovered in bath salts.
