<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
