<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided superb service for us in changing a really balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not only was he extremely professional and comprehensive however he had the ability to respond to all my questions concerning the service. If I could, I would provide 6 stars. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most reliable methods of locating the exact whereabouts of a plumbing issue. A plumber will insert a specially created water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to identify where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
