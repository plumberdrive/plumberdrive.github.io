<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should initially acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you mean to do. You can take a look at our Authorization page to find out more on acquiring a license. Once you obtain a permit you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you must require inspection prior to you cover or conceal any work.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts off, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Image 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
