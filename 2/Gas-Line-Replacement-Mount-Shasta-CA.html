<p>Aside from these two essential parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
