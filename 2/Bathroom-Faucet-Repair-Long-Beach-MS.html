<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
