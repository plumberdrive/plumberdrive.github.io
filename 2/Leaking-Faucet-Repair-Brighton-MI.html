<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Brighton MI</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Toilets are difficult things to know. They have actually been developed practically the exact same method for hundreds of years, so you can't really tell how old they are. It might not work extremely well all the time, however you can't tell if that's regular or not. Plus, there's that universal but never unacknowledged sensation that it's you-you're somehow doing something incorrect in there.</p>
