Which is why picking a comfy, well-made toilet seat is incredibly crucial. However, you have to make sure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, nevertheless, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem.
