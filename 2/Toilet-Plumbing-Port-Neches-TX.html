<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger issue to analyze. If your toilet is relatively brand-new, you may need to change bathroom tissue or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing firms to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand name is normally on the bowl behind the seat. In some cases, the design or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can become an experimental procedure. Even professional plumbers often try two or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
