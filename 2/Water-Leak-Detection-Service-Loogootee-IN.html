<p>If you find yourself continuously jiggling the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to employ among our licensed Columbus plumbers to assist you in finding the leak or broken element and repairing it. Grease: Never pour grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Instead of getting rid of, these products frequently harden to form nasty obstructions, which you may need a plumber to remove.</p>

<p>Typically triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is generally the fix. Alternatively, often a malfunctioning fill valve may actuate intermittently, too. Water will not drain or is draining slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create serious drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the concern for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is occurring to your house.</p>
