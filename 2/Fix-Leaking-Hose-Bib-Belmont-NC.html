<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively since hard water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized throughout regrowth. Finally, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
