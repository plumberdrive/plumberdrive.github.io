<p>Purchase a borax replacement water softer in the EU and it's immensely likely you will be purchasing a box of sodium sesquicarbonate - Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2 WATER. Sodium sesquicarbonate is a hydrated crystal made up from salt carbonate and salt bicarbonate and is really commonly found in bath salts. Running a gas line does need either a building license or a plumbing permit. For more complex setups and jobs, special or additional licenses might be needed. You should also inspect the inspections required for your task.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.
