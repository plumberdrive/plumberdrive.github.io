<p>While fighting a fire, firemens are naturally more worried about drawing enough water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to attain their goal, but fire department cars often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted appropriately (Image 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you very first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
