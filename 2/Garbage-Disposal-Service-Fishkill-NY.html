<p>Another common misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is an effective kind of rust control. There is a lack of scientific proof supporting this claim, nevertheless. Scale does not form in uniform homogeneous layers that would safeguard pipe from corrosion Scale can be soft or permeable and is highly irregular. Deterioration can still take place under conditions that are favorable to the development of hard-water scale and even when hard-water scale is currently present.</p>
<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
