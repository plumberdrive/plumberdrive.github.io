<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might take place. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly protected, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Reduced to TAC, this method uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline form that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are microscopic and flow normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regeneration.</p>
