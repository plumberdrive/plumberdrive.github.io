If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>The usual option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually struggles with corrosion and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
