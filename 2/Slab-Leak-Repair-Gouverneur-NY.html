<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and responsibility are exceptionally essential to developing a credibility for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water system within a structure these gadgets are referred to as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
