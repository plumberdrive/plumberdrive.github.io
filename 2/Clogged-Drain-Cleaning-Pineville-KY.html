<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and fast rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the system). Each cycle will release 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of hardness minerals and chloride that you may not desire simply running outside. Not to mention plumbing code may be violated without appropriate backflow prevention.</p>
