<p>Old, worn, or harmed plumbing pipes can cause considerable problems. Even small leakages can gradually moisten walls and floors up until they end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes might become rusty and include rust to the supply of water. Gurgling noise from pipes.

The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
