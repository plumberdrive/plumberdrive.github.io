<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a larger issue to analyze. You may need to switch toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is relatively brand-new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing firms to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>It assists to understand the brand name and design of your toilet. The brand is generally on the bowl behind the seat. In many cases, the design or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can end up being an experimental process. Even professional plumbers in some cases try two or three flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
