Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
