While gas models are less expensive to run, they do require an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electrical water heater is usually lower, but it can be more pricey to operate. Electric ranges are also simpler to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>

If it is close to the variety of years the hot water heater was ranked for, consider replacement rather of repair.</p>
