<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also take place if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the system in a steady and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait till after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You need to also check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
