<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to buy a backflow valve if you discover your water has an uncommon flow, taste, odor or color.

Assemblies not currently noted must have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
