You may need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is fairly brand-new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing details. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
