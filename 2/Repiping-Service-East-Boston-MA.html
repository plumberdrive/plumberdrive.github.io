<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts down, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm.

<p>It's an on-demand water heater and conserves a great deal of energy. When it is needed, it warms water just. Data suggests that a tankless heater can conserve approximately 34% energy as compared to conventional heaters for homes that use up to 41 gallons of warm water daily. Families that use a great deal of water, around 86 gallons per day, can also save up to 14% energy by using these heaters in place of traditional water heaters. In reality, a household can attain energy savings of up to 50% by setting up a tankless heater at each hot water outlet.</p>
