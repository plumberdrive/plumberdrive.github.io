Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
