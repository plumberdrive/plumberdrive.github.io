This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm.

Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
