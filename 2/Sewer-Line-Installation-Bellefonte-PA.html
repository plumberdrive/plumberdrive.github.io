<p>Surface Area Accelerated Crystallization is an invention that simulates biomineralization, the system frequently acknowledged for structured development in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by using exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely remove momentary hardness in water.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are significantly damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
