<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is fairly short. Soft or crisp foods are fine, however hard or stringy foods can be problem. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the typical kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring twist-ties and pads.
