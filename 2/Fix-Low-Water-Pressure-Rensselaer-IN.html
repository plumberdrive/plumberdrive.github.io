<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>A leaking water heater can trigger more severe problems if left unrepaired. They can also threaten and can lead to mold or even damage to the structure of your home. That's why you must never postpone a repair. A professional plumber will be able to precisely find the source of the leak and suggest the best option. Nevertheless, if the hot water heater is beyond repair it may be time to consider setting up a brand-new system.</p>
