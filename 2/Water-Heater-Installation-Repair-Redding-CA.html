<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
