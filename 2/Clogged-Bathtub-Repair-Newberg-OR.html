Tough water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>
