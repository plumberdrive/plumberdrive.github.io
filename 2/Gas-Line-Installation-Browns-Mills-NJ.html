<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal can be found in 2 fundamental types - constant feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in location to operate the system. Constant feed is common and the most convenient to utilize; a batch feed design is much safer but can be slower to utilize on big amounts of food waste since you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company supplies a summary of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
