<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for locals. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can often develop on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink. If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will drip into the cabinet beneath. A decreased pressure backflow preventer is the top of the line when it pertains to backflow preventers, and is the device of choice due to the fact that it can endure the intro of fertilizer or other chemicals, it's also a smart option for residential water supply.</p>
