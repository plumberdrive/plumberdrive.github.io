<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Washingtonville NY</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
