<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth understanding about waste disposal unit installation.

<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation.
