<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Altoona PA</h3>
<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal can be found in 2 standard types - constant feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover be in location to operate the unit. Continuous feed is common and the simplest to use; a batch feed design is safer but can be slower to utilize on large quantities of food waste due to the fact that you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers a summary of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
