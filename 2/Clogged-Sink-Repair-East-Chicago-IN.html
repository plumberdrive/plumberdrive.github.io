<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage smell originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indication of a serious problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house may have burst or otherwise broken. It is essential that you get in touch with a certified plumber if there is a persistent sewage odor in your house. Raw sewage is really harmful and can present serious health risks.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
