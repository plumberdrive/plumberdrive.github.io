Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
