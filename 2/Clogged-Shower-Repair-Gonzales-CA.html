<p>Don't put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and potentially cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and blockages - consider composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can gather and congeal in your drain too. After ending up cooking, consider putting leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
