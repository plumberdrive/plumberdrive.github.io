If your home was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you hire a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. Opportunities are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimal rates if your house was built years before that.</p>
