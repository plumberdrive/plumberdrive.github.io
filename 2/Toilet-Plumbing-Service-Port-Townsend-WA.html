<p>It's challenging to determine if you have actually cracked or broken drains up until a video inspection is carried out. Split or broken drains are usually preceded by repeating obstructions, constant nasty drain smells or the existence of sewer flies.

If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted properly (Photo 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
