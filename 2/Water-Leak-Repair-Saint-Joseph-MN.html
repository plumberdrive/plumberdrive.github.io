<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
