<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Montrose CA 91020</h3>

Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
