<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification.

<h3>Blocked Drains in Ashtabula Ohio</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your backyard.

Using the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
