<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
