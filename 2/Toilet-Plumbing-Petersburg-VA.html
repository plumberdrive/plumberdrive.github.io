<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Petersburg VA 23803?</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to obstructions that come from inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, likewise known as tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will identify the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly flow toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream might trigger a reversal in flow.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes.

If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
