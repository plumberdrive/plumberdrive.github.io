<p>Once per year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running smoothly, we advise that house owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.

It may be time to call a professional plumber if you have actually tried to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink with no luck. They can figure out the place of the blockage and the best ways to unclog the bottleneck without damaging your plumbing.</p>
