<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician switched off the supply of water and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to eliminate the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture.

<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It is very important to enjoy what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger jams and obstructions - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can cake and collect in your drain also. After completing cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
