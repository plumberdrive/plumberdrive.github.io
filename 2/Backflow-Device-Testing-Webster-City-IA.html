<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
