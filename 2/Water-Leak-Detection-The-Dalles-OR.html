Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining fixture itself. Obstructions in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>

In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a shoddy plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
