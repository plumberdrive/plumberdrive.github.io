<p>Setting up a new gas line in the kitchen will typically range from $300 to $800 depending upon the length of the pipe needed. If you're transforming your house to gas, or if the existing line is at capacity, anticipate to spend $2,000 or more.

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
