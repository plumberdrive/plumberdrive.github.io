<p>House owners often ask if a gas water heater or an electrical system is more cost-efficient. The response depends on your home. While gas designs are less expensive to run, they do require an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical water heater is usually lower, but it can be more pricey to operate.

As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that hazard, mercaptans are included into gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking.
