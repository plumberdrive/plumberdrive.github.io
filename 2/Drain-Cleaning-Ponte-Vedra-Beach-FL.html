<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing installed throughout construction of a brand-new or remodelled building is set up by educated craftsmen in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.
