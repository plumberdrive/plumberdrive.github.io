<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
