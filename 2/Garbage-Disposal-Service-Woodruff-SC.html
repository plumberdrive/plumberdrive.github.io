Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals come with this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they don't wear out as fast.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
