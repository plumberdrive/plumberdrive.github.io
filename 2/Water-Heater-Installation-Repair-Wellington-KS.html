<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Wellington KS</h3>
<p>The most effective method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You hear water running or dripping in the tank. A backflow takes place when water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system.
