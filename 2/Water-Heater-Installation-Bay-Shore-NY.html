<p>Galvanized steel potable water supply and circulation pipes are commonly discovered with small pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively costly, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements usually found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications. It is also incredibly durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most commonly used pipe product for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
