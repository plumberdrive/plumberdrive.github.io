It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage needs to likewise be provided.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification.
