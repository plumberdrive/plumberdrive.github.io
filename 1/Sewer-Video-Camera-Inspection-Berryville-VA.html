<p>It can take numerous weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, plans for each device to be set up should be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may use up to three weeks or more to process and approve.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
