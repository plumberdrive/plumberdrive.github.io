It may be regular to have condensation on warm water pipes, but it's certainly not typical for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try disposing a tray of ice down the drain, and after that turn on the garbage disposal while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it also. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or exhausted, worn sink? No problem is too great for our highly trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our knowledgeable plumbing group gets the job done rapidly and affordably.</p>
