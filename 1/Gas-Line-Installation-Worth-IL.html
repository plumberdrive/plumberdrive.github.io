<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid usually will assist eliminate them if you have rust areas. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest technique perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust first.. No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't work then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and security warnings first!).

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line blockages are not something a house owner can fix.
