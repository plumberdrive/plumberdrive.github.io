<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water supply and distribution pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is rarely utilized today for brand-new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often recognized merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and challenging to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also very resilient and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most widely used pipe material for fire sprinklers and gas.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
