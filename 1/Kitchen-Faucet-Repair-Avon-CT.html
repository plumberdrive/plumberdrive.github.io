<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically causes the yard above it to end up being soggy. You might smell the horrible smell of sewage prior to you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it required to cordon off that part of your yard. Because the swampiness will attract unwanted animals, the scenario is laden with problems. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's phone number is on your speed dial.</p>
