<p>Any location water runs through house. This includes sinks, toilets, pipes, tubs, and lines. At this time, the pro will search for leaks and broken pipes or fittings.

<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. If your toilet is relatively brand-new, you may need to change toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear a clog from the drain. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing details.

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
