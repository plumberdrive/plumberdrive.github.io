<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these unfavorable effects. Gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a security precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers gas an odor typically connected with rotten eggs. This distinct fragrance allows you to smell a possible leak if it takes place. If you suspect a leak, constantly leave.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
