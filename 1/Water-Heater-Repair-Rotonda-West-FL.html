<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Rotonda West FL</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under the house is merely the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can range from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, sometimes in concrete. It is rather typical to leave the old pipes in place after disconnecting them. The new pipe is merely set up in the path of least resistance. Depending on the design of your house, the pipe can be installed in the attic or under a crawl space.</p>
