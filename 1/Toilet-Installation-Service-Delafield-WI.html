<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
