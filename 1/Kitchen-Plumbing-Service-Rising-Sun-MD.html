<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Rising Sun MD</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
