<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
