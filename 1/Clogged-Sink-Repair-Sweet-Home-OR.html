<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Sweet Home OR</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your building requires a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not pose a threat to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>All of these issues are simple and typical to deal with when dealt with early. By calling Bell Cow at (844) 234-2355 upon first noticing a problem, you can avoid more major concerns brought on by leaks, like structural damage. Don't get milked by your water costs either!
