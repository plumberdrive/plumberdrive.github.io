The backflow preventer may be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations.

Assemblies not currently noted should have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>The old disposal has to be disconnected initially. Garbage disposals are usually linked at the base therefore this is where the process begins. Some electrical understanding is required to ensure the wires are detached correctly. Answer: No!

<p>The most common approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, generally salt. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered really low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
