<p>You live in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try dumping a tray of ice down the drain, and after that turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it too. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or worn out, worn sink? No issue is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing team finishes the job quickly and economically.</p>
