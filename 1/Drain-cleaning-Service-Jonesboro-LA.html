<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see but hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>

<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
