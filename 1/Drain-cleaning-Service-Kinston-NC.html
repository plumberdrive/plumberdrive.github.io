The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both places.

Assemblies not currently listed should have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation.
