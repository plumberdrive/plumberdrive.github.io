<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
