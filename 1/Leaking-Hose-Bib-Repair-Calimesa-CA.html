It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
