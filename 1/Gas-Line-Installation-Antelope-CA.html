<p>We offer emergency drain repair services for split and breached drain lines that will help you to prevent potentially bigger problems in the future.

Throughout a repipe, plumbers will make strategic cuts in the drywall, entirely replace the pipes, re-install the eliminated drywall and spot it to remove any signs of damage or modification to your home.</p>

A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.
