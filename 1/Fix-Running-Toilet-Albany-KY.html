<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see however rarely stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this may work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the same material as other pipes in your home, suggesting that problem could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you peace of mind and avoid larger leakages down the road.</p>
