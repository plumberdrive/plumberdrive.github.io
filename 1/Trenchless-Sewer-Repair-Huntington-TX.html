<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are not surprisingly more concerned about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they utilize water from any offered source to achieve their objective, but fire department automobiles often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
