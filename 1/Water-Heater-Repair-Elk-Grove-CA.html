<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
