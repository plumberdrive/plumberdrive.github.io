<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
