<p>Aside from these two important parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less critical things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
