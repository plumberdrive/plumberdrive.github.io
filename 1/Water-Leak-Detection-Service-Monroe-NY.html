<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
