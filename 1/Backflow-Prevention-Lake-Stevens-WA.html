Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
