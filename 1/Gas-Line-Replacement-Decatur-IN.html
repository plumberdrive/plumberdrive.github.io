<p>Backpressure may happen when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a building permit is normally needed before a plumbing permit can be issued. Soften just what you need to.
