<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Vinton IA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>Depending on the degree of the clog, we might use a range of different methods, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced kind of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to totally clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and get rid of wire connectors. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp adapter and remove wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
