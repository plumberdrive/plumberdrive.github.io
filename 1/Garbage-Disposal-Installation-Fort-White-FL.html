Leaks can likewise take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing.
