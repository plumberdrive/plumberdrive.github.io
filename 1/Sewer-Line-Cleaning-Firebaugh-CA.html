<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
