<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and cheap. However discovering the right washer might not be. The most common washers are often offered in the house centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
