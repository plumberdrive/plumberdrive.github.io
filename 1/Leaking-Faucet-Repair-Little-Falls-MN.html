<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
