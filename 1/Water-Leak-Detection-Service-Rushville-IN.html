<p>One common way for a home's water system to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem might spread greatly. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in private residences, it likewise prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
