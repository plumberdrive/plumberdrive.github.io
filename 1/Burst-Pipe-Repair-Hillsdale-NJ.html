<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily. Water softening can avoid these negative results. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas an odor often related to rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinctive fragrance permits you to smell a possible leak. If you think a leak, always leave.</p>

<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and may sometimes leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink movie is really a harmless germs that comes from the sea salt. If this stain is an inconvenience in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to among the other 2 types of salts.

<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the expertise to diagnose an issue and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
