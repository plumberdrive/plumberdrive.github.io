<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Windsor NC</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.

A standard by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
