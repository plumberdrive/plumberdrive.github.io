<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your house. Even if the issue stems with the local system, it's still wise to bring in the professionals to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
