<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it usually catches deterioration after about 50 years and requires replacement. Even more modern pipes won't last forever, so watch on plumbing systems that might be reaching the end of their lifespan.</p>
<h3>Clean Out Installation in Weston Connecticut</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

This can cause your utility expense to soar and can be an indication that you need to install a brand-new one.
