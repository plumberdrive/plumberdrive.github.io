<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department should satisfy or go beyond the state standards and bring the responsibility for imposing them.</p>
