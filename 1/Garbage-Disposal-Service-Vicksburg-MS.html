Houses integrated in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed utilizing lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, let alone the health dangers associated with lead.</p>
<p>Whether you have a waste disposal unit and it's not working correctly, or if it's finally time to install one in your home, a waste disposal unit is a previous luxury that is nearly a necessity in these times. Always continue to run water throughout and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain.</p>

As piping installation and repair experts, we can fix problems or mention when it will be safer or more cost-effective to simply redo your piping system.
