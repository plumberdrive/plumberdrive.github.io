<p>I can't say enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had an extremely short quantity of time due to closing on a house sale. Every individual I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work crew. Friendly, communicated well, completely responsive and actually cared to help me through this really stressful task. All of the people I encountered were role models for what a well run service company must be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're terrific.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed effectively (Picture 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
