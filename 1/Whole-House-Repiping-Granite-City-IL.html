<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear.
