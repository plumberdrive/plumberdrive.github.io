<p>The very best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities site is by installing a pressure reducing valve (PRV). A PRV will regulate water pressure as it enters the home.

<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't demand fixing the entire toilet. Like any home appliance, a toilet tank features lots of little moving parts that may need replaced with usage in time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
