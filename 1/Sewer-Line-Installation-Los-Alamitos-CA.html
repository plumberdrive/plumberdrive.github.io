<p>If you have a septic system, then you might mistakenly believe that you can not have a waste disposal unit, and this is not true. Nevertheless, property owners with waste disposal unit and septic tanks may need to pump their septic regularly.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
