<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was very happy with their service.</p>
