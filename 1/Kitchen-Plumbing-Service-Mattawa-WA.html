<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
