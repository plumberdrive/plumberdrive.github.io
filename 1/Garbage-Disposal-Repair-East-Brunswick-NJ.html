<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes East Brunswick NJ</h3>
<p>To identify if your house is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of the clog, we might use a range of various methods, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced type of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to totally clear out whatever inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and get rid of wire connectors. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp connector and remove wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
