<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth learning about waste disposal unit installation. You count on your water heater every day for all the warm water you and your family need to prepare, clean, and bathe.

<p>Tough water can leave your hair looking dry and dull and your skin feeling scratchy and flakey, and that's only what it does to your body. In your home, difficult water mineral build-up on faucets and showerheads triggers them to lose effectiveness and function, and etching and identifying on your glass wares makes it look like you never ever even ran the dishwasher.</p>

Also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
