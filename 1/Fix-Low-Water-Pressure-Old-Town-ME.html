<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Installing natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As hard water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water adhere to the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>

You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
