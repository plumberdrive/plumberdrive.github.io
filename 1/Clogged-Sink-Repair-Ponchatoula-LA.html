<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your house. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home might have burst or otherwise broken. It is important that you contact a qualified plumber if there is a consistent sewage odor in your home. Raw sewage is very dangerous and can position major health risks.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the public utility includes some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and more delicious. As such, water filtration systems are vital requirements, not optional expenditures. A house plumbing inspection will either be visual, finished with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>It normally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you discover low water pressure or discolored water. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health danger in your water.</p>
