<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really important part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
