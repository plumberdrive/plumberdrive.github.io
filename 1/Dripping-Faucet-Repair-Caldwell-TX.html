<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
