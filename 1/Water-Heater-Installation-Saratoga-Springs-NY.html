House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
