Prior to you can ask for an inspection, you should initially get the required authorization( s) for the work you mean to do.

<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>

Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
