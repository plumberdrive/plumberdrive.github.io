<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about securing people's lives and to a lesser extent their home. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source readily available to accomplish that objective. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome indicate that the level of security on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high danger defense level.</p>

If it remains in a garage and a small sluggish leak, schedule a quote as soon as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
