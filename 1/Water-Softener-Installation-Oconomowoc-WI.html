When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and household.</p>
