<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in studs, floorings, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
