<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear.
