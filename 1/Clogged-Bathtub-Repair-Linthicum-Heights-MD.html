<p>These people were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great reviews and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
