<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Whitehall MI 49461</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products including harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can occur gradually from the buildup of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog becomes larger with time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining correctly. You can combat hard water in different ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
