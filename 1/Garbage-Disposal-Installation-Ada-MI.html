<p>One typical method for a home's water system to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem could spread out exponentially. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in private residences, it also avoids wastewater in personal homes from receding out and infecting the public water system.</p>
