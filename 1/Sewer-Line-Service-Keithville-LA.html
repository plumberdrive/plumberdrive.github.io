<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>If you notice low water pressure or discolored water, it usually represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>Some customers like to have softer water and pick to install a water softening system. Once again, it's personal preference and completely up to the specific customer.
