<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is simple and cheap. But finding the best washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered in the house centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
