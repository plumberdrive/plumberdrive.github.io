<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair technician knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Solid Clogs: Professional assistance is the best remedy, if you find yourself presented with an especially stubborn clog. You may end up doing more damage than good if you continue to fight with it, which can create long-term problems. If you do not have a skilled look into your clog scenario, sewage back-flow is another major concern.</p>
