<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system.

Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
