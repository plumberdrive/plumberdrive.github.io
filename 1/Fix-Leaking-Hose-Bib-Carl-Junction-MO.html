<p>Bought happy medium stainless-steel blade model readily available at Lowes. Got a little local plumber who overcharged me, I believe. $212 with tax for installation just, incl. new $25 strainer for the sink. Approx. 1 hour work for two men.

<p>Inside the home, examine the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leaks or drips. Inspect below sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber quoted cost of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I checked around. Under the sink, place a container or pan beneath the waste pipe, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, readily available in a single-tank "cabinet" design. It is highly advised for either local or well water supplies.
