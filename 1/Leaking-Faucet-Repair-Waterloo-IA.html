<p>Inspect the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is simple and cheap. But discovering the best washer might not be. The most typical washers are typically readily available at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be hard to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
