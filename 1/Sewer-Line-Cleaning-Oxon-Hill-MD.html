<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
