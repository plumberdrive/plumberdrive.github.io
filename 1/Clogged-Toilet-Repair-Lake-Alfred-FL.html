<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
