<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
