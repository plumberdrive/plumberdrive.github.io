<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
