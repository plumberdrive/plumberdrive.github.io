Many standard property owners insurance coverage and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your home.</p>
<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a house owner.

New meters need to meet regulations and code requirements for their placement, and gas service providers might require an unique meter for their services, limiting your options.
