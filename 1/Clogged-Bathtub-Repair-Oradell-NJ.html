<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the hardness ions to speed up.
