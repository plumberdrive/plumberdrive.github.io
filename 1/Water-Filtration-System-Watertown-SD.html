<p>Check the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and offered for usage. Likewise, rust of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of rust.</p>
