<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
