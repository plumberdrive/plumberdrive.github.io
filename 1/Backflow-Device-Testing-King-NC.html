<p>Household owned and ran since 2003, RT Plumbing Services provides industry-leading plumbing knowledge, home renovating service, and water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX neighborhood. It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations based on water damage. Adequate drainage needs to also be offered.</p>
