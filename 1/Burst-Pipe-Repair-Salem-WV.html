<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
