When connecting the water lines, solder the copper fittings before you screw them to the tank so you don't warm the tank itself while soldering (Picture 5).</p>

However, throughout routing plumbing inspections, a complete test of all drains will be performed.

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more reliable at getting rid of obstructions. Many houses have drain cleanouts, however, we come across older houses without cleanouts.
