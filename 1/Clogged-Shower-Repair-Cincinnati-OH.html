Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
