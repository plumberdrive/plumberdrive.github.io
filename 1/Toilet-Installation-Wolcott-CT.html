As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell often related to rotten eggs. This unique fragrance enables you to smell a prospective leak if it occurs. If you suspect a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>1. Install a lint-catcher: Your washing machine's water line is accountable for bringing the water out of the machine after it's done washing.
