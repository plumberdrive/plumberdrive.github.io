By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to offer some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
