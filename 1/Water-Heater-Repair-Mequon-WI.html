<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Toilets can be tricky and picky at times, depending on what parts have stopped working and the particular situation of your installation.
