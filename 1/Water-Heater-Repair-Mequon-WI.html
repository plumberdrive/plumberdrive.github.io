Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
<p>Toilets can be tricky and picky at times, depending on what parts have stopped working and the particular situation of your installation.
