<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
