<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health hazard if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or illness.</p>
