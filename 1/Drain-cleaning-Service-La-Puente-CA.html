<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to resolve the problem. Other times a more comprehensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal must not leak. It typically suggests wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up when this occurs.
