The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.
