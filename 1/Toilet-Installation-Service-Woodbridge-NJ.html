Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>This is a complicated task that should constantly be delegated an experienced professional from McAtee Plumbing Heating & Cooling using the current tools and time-tested techniques. You can not merely replace the a few of the bad piping, rather, to avoid future pricey repairs and guarantee a long life expectancy, the whole piping system on your Charleston home need to be replaced.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
