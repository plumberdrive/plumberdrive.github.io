A standard manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
