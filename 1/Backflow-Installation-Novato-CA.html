<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's concealed; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with a shoddy plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
