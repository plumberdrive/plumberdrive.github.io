Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
