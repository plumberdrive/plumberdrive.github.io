<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
