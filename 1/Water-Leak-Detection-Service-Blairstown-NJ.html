Often deals with are toilet parts that get rusty or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it pull back appropriately. It's a simple repair, however there's a trick to getting the flush deal with out. The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Photo 1). Then get rid of the old deal with and lever, slide the brand-new handle into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Photo 2).</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank.
