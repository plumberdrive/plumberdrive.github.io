<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property. The camera is manually manipulated on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the professional to precisely examine conditions and diagnose the functionality of the pipes. The info we glean from the inspection allows us to make a notified decision concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the best option as well.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Gas line leaks are a serious safety concern. Don't take any chances. Ensure the softener is set to the solidity of your water system. If the solidity is set too expensive, the softener will cost more to run and lose water, costing you extra money.
