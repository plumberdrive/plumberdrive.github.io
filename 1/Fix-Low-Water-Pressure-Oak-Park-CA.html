<p>Irrigation backflow devices are created for installation on safe and clean water lines to protect against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the drinkable water system.

<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To maintain your safety, house, and health comfort, we utilize only the best piping: polyethylene.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
