<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Depending on your scenario, your plumber may utilize one or a combination of piping material during your house repiping task. Copper is basic since it's lasting, can endure fires, and withstands weather condition. However, copper is tough to install, which suggests higher labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which implies plumbers can bend the pipes removing the need for joints, which conserves time and money and minimizes the threat of joint leakages. PEX likewise withstands rust and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending on your needs.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little filling dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk protection assembly.</p>

<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
