The factors for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating element or thermostat. A repair or replacement of the parts might suffice if it is one of the pointed out problems. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place frequently, then a hot water heater replacement is needed.</p>
