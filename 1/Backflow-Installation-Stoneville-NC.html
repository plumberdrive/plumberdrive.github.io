<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and duty are exceptionally important to developing a credibility for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable water system within a building these devices are known as seclusion" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
