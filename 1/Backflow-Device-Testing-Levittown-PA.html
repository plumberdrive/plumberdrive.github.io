<p>One common way for a home's supply of water to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which might become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem might spread greatly. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and infecting the general public water system.</p>

Having the drain back up or the foul smell of a malfunctioning sewer drain in your home is more than a trouble, it makes everything else stop. When this occurs you need a plumbing company that can get there quick. Recognize the complete magnitude of the issue, and fix it fast.</p>
