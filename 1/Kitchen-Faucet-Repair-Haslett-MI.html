<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
