For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
