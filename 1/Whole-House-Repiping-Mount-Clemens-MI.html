<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable option, particularly when simple plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
