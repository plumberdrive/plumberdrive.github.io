<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
