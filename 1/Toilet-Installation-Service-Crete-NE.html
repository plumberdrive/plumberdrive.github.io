<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Crete NE 68333</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
