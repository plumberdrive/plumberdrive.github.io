Homes integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no idea that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, let alone the health risks associated with lead.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pressed forward into the home, enabling it to stream backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
