<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service at Ridge NY 11961?</h3>
<p>If you are wanting to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has begun to leak, very first consider your choices. A full sewer pipe replacement might not be needed. Frequently, relining your existing pipes is a much better alternative. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near comprehensive landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, total sewer excavation can trigger a lot of civilian casualties (and cost) to the surrounding area.</p>

This does not include the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with additional functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
