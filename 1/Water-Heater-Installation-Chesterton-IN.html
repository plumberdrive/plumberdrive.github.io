<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
