When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

Clogs in a fixture can trigger damaging damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to supply decades of protection. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
