This goes for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a great start if whatever is working appropriately.</p>
<p>Your storm drains don't go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually funnelled somewhere else to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
