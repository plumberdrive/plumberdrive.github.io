<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the service is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to fix the issue. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It is necessary to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and obstructions - consider composting or positioning these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain also. After ending up cooking, consider putting remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
