<p>Many common single household home systems won't need supply piping larger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to cost along with steel piping's tendency to end up being obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the within the pipe over time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has actually degraded. In drinkable water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with destructive water impurities.</p>
