<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
