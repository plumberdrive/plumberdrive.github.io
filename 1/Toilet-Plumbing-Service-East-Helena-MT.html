<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid normally will assist eliminate them. If you want to attempt the gentlest approach maybe attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security warnings first!), if that does not do the technique.
