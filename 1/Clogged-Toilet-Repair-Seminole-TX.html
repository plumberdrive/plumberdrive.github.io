<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you need to most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
