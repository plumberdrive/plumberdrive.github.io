Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
