<p>When the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital locations in the assembly.

<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
