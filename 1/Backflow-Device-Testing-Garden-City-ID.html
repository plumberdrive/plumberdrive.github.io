These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
