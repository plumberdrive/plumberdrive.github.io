<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, however if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to take a look at. If your toilet is reasonably new, you might need to switch toilet tissue or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain.

Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical service, specifically when simple plunging doesn't appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
