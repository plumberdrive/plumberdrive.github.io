<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
