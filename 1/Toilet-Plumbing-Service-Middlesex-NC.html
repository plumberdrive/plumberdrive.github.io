<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less critical things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
