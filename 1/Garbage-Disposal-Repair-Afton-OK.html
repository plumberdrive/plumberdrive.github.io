<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more brittle and susceptible to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected. Certain pipe materials have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and pressures as a result of temperature change and ice formation. And these differences dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the existence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no unfavorable results and are, in fact, necessary everyday nutrients.

However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of detergents and soaps. At this moment the water is said to be hard.</p>
