Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
