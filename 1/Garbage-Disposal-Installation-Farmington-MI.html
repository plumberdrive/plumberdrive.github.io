Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure.

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
