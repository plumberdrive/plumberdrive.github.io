<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>

If your toilet is relatively brand-new, you may need to switch toilet tissue or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain.
