<p>If you experience blockages and backups in your home more than a few times, it's an excellent idea to have a professional assess your drain system. A drain expert like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system.

The camera can find and recognize the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, replacing a gas or electric water tank with a similar model takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old water heater. Positioning the new system takes approximately 30 minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to protect the new connection points and confirm that all functions depend on code.</p>
<p>A common gas line can cost up to $1,000. The labor expenses increase if the gas line is under a walkway, sprinkler system or trees. Drain cleaning is something that you will ultimately need to handle in any house.

Now, there are many solutions to obstructions, relying on the severity of the obstruction.</p>
