<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible impurities can then enter the safe and clean water system. The very best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running smoothly, we advise that house owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least.

Sometimes whatever is clogging the drain will not budge. If you've attempted to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink without any luck, it may be time to call a professional plumber. They can figure out the area of the obstruction and the best methods to unclog the traffic jam without damaging your plumbing.</p>
