The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
