<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
