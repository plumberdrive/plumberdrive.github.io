<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
