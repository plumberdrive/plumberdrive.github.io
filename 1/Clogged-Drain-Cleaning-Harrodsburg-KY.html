Considering the life span of a disposal, it would also be unnecessarily expensive to acquire all the products and tools required for the job.

The water is constantly heated up as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated up if the tap is instantly changed off.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
