<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
