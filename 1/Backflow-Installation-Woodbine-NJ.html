<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Introduced more than a years ago, Uponor ProPEX fittings remain the surest technique for making leak-proof Uponor PEX-a connections quickly and easy. Capitalizing on the distinct, thermal shape memory of Uponor's PEX-a tubing, fittings in fact get more powerful with time. No need to fret about behind-the-wall connections - ProPEX joints will last the life of the building.</p>
