<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>The very best method to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities website is by installing a pressure lowering valve (PRV).

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
