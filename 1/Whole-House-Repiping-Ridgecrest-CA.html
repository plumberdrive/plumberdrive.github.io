<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Ridgecrest CA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
