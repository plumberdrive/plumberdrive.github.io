<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the general public water system and personal on-site water system and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention techniques.

A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts break, they lead to tiny leakages that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
