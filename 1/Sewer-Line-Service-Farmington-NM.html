<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working successfully because difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use more and more cleaning agent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and sanitized throughout regeneration. Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
