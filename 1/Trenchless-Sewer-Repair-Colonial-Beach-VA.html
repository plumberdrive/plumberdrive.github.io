The city or Uruk contains the earliest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had exchangeable and quickly removable sections, and permitted cleaning.</p>

Finally, water including the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
