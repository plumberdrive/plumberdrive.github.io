<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing New City NY</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent evaluations and a fair cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>This is extremely essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system.
