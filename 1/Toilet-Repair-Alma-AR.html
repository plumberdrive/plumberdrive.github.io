<p>Your hot water heater is one of the most crucial elements of your home's plumbing system Water heaters are responsible for producing all of the heated water you need for bathing, cleaning, cooking, and taking care of other day-to-day tasks. When something fails, and you're not getting the hot water you need, it's time to call a professional. When a consumer calls you with a plumbing emergency, you need support from a company who comprehends your industry.

If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. You may need to switch toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is fairly new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can search for your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
