<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can take place in time from the accumulation of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog ends up being larger with time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes correctly. You can fight tough water in numerous ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap builds up down the drain because they typically contain grease and fat. When the fat of the soap combines with mineral water, it forms a solid residue and sticks to the pipes, clogging them.
