<p>Check Valve (DCV) - safe for use both indoors and underground, DCVs are a little bit more expensive but are also extremely convenient, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Camera work in finding buried septic tanks or examining the condition of buried pipes to figure out appropriate maintenance schedules or the extent of necessary repairs. When the corrupt sales representative takes control of the camera, he may play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in very bad condition and say it is your pipe.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
