<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with difficult water, you might not realize just how much it affects you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from tough water. Hard water hinders the lathering of shampoos and soaps, triggering you to utilize more. Hard water likewise makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>
