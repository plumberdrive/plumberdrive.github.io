<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can infect the water supply. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. All leakages, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire combating water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction. In this post we take a look at plumbers vs. plumbing contractors and specialized plumbers. RPZ backflow systems, on the other hand, have valves that just open when water is streaming forward.</p>
