<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Oakton VA</h3>
<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water pipe are usually blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it goes into the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
