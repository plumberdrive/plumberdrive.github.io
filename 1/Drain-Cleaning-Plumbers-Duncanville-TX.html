<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
