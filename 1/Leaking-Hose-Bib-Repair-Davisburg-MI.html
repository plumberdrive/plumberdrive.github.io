Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
