It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
