<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized.

Nevertheless, to prevent off that hazard, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking.
