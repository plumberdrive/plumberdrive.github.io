Multiple back-ups typically indicate your sewage system is stopping working.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets should absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
