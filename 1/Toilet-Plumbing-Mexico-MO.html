<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

You, therefore, need to utilize a growing number of detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and decontaminated during regeneration. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
