<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of keeping the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your system, this might be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating element. Lacking hot water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is essential to view what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause clogs and jams - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and collect in your drain as well. After completing cooking, think about pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
