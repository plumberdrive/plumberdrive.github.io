<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
