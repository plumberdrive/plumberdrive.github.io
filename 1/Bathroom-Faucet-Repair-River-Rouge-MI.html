<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
