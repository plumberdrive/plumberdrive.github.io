<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Toilet flush manages are another part of a toilet that can trigger toilets to keep running. Frequently handles are toilet parts that get corroded or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down properly. It's an easy repair, but there's a trick to getting the flush deal with out. The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Image 1). Then get rid of the old manage and lever, slide the brand-new manage into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
