<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
