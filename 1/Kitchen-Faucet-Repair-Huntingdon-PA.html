The installation must be examined to guarantee it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test data should be built up to identify the workings of each element. The backflow prevention assembly must be dismantled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated once again to be sure it was effectively repaired. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is needed to guarantee it was fixed correctly.

<p>Examine the house's hot water heater You will be aiming to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be warmed and available for usage. Likewise, rust of the tank's components can trigger the tank to have a brief life. If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent indications of rust, demand that a new one be installed.</p>
