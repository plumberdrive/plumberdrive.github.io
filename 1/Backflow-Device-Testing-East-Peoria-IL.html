Frequently, relining your existing pipes is a better option. If your sewer lines are beneath trees, near substantial landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, overall sewer excavation can trigger a lot of collateral damage (and cost) to the surrounding area.</p>

Residences integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes.
