<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals described as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're really correct, a sink waste disposal unit."

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
