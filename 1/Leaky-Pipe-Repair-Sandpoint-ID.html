<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes.
