<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>There are health and safety risks one need to avoid while dealing with a sewer line task. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are discovered in sewer pipes and may expose employees during the sewer repair process. If your DIY dig strikes a natural gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a risk of fire or explosion damage to your property or your next-door neighbor's. Another threat in sewer repair tasks is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig website. Your safety and health are too essential to risk in a DIY sewer project! Avoid these security threats by employing a professional plumber.</p>
