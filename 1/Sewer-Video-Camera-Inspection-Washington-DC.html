Once the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
