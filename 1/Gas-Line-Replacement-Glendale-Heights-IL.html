<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence utilized to visually examine the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to figure out the condition of small diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
