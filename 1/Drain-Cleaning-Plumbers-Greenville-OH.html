<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of constant or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
