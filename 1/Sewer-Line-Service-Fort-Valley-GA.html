<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Fort Valley GA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>You have actually got an issue with over-running or leaking if the sound of your toilet continuously running is normal to you. This water is being discarded down the overflow tube losing as much as 200 gallons of water per day. That takes a toll on your water costs, not to point out the danger of a more severe leak that could wreak havoc on your home with flooding.</p>
