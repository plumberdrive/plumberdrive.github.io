<h3>Tips For Finding A Cheap Plumber Matthews NC</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
