<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Etowah TN 37331</h3>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
