<p>Since it can spread out infected water back through a distribution system, Backflow is a possible issue in a water system. For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any real or possible connection in between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can permit pollutants or contaminants to get in the drinkable water system. Illness can arise from ingesting water that has been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>Once set up, these BPAs undergo regular and preliminary testing and maintenance requirements to verify their continued operational efficiency. Such testing must be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also offered online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Information ).</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk defense assembly.</p>
