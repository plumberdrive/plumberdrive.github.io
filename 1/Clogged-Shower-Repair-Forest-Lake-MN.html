<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
