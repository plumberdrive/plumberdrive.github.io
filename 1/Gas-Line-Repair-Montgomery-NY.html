It is one of the most pre-owned plumbing component that with time if not looked after could cause a big issue at the owners cost. As seen on the above photo, there are many parts to a kitchen sink. A kitchen sink repair could be as simple as altering a shut off valve or as complicated as repairing the drain assembly to your kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a garbage disposal is just equipped to deal with softer organic waste. If bones or other tough foods get stuck in the disposal, it could trigger it to jam and not work correctly. By running hot water through the disposal, you might be able to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>Roto-Rooter's plumbers are specialists in sink repair and are all set to fix your clogged sink or carry out a sink installation to fulfill your needs.
