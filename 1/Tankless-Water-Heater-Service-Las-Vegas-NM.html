<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
<p>It's an oddly intricate scientific procedure, however simple to fix. It uses salt to eliminate smells and minerals found in tough water- most frequently calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that attach and draw in sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push difficult water through the resin beads exchanging firmness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
