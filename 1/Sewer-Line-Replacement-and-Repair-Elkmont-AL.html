<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for residents. A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>

Regrowth instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
