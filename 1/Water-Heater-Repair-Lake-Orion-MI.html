<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material utilized in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it typically catches corrosion after about 50 years and needs replacement. Much more modern pipes won't last permanently, so watch on plumbing systems that might be reaching the end of their lifespan.</p>
