<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent indications of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your home.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
