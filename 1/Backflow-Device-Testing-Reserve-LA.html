Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
