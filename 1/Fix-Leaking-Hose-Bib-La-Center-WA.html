<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
