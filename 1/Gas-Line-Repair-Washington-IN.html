Throughout regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
