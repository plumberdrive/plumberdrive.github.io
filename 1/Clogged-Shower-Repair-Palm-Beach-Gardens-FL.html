<p>No, you need to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be much more destructive than handy, potentially gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, including both supply of water and drain lines. Typically, a whole-house repipe deserves the financial investment in the long run due to the fact that it might address the root reason for the chronic plumbing problems in your home.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is identified "soft" or "tough" is dependent on the presence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no negative effects and are, in reality, essential everyday nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the revitalizing flavor many people discover preferable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the effectiveness of detergents and soaps. At this point the water is said to be hard.</p>
<p>When pipes are arranged into a vertical form it is described as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop need to be greater than 33 feet to function properly. When developed in this manner it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water system. Plumb Crazy Plumbing provides a standard one month warranty on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year warranty on replacement plumbing tasks.</p>
