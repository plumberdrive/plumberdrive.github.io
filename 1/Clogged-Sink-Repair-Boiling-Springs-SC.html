<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC specializes in the installation and repair of commercial and residential gas and lp gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and consultation services. If your commercial property already has a backflow preventer, you are accountable for having it tested every year by a third-party Backflow Tester from our Approved Tester List We will alert you by mail when it's time for your backflow test.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
