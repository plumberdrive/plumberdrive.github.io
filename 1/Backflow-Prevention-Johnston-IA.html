Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
