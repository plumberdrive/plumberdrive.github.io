<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve is part of the unit for that precise factor. But while little drips should not be trigger for issue, property owners need to keep an eye on the water heater leakages. When we required a leak in a pipe fixed, I had a fantastic experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was professional and friendly. He also finished the job faster than original approximated, so the work was less costly than I prepared for. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed. Schedule an estimate as soon as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
