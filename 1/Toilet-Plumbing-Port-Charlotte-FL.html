<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually preserved at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
