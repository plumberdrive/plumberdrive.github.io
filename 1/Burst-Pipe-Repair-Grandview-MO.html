<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
