If your home was constructed before the 1970s, we highly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your home was built decades before that, chances are that your home may need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at ideal rates.</p>
