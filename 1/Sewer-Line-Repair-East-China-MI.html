Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
