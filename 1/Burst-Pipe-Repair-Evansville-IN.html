<p>No, you ought to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system.

Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, consisting of both supply of water and drain lines.

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
