The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
