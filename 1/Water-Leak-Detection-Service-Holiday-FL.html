<p>Your sewer line carries wastewater away from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your home. A damaged gas line is a really major problem, and often an issue will emerge at the most bothersome times.

At Mr. Rooter Plumbing of Pittsburgh, we make sure that our clients are pleased and safe at all times. That's why we provide 24 hr emergency services for local Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area home and company owner. If you face a last minute problem, call our office anytime and we will send a rescue team to your area right away, 24 hr a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Utilize the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have actually spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause significant damage if the leak isn't identified quickly.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain correctly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help.

Call a Sears Handyman representative today to go over repair options.</p>
