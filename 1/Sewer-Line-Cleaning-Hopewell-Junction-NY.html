<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
