<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the property, allowing it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health threat if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
