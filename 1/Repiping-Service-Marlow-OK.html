<p>A. If you have rust areas, utilizing phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. If you would like to try the gentlest technique possibly try using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. Then utilize Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and security warnings initially!), if that doesn't do the trick.
