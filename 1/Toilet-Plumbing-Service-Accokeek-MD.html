<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Accokeek MD</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You might have to check out using a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. There are 2 basic piping products used by plumbing specialists. PEX and copper both provide many advantages and benefits such as eliminating the metallic taste from your water.</p>
