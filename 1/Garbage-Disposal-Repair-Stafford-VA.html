<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
