<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
