<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed properly (Image 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white areas on your meals that will not disappear, white t-shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a stubborn layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll be happy to understand that water softening can remove these problems and more. Tough water causes these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to worry about any concerns with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes chores simpler and less irritating for everyone involved.</p>
