<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "tough" depends on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no unfavorable impacts and are, in reality, important daily nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the refreshing taste many people find desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the efficiency of detergents and soaps. At this moment the water is said to be hard.</p>
