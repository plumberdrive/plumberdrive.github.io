Sediment Build-Up: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this might be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking hot water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to carry out website inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is required as a result of a potential or actual cross-connection risk on a client's plumbing system.
