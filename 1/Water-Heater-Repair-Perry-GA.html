<p>We have an inspection program to identify water sources and scenarios that require backflow prevention devices. For home, it is important for owners to notify the District if any changes are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial property, the District examines the use of each new tenant. If the existing backflow is not up to District code, the correction must be made before water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the residential or commercial property or the renter owner.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the major culprits. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce severe drain obstructions by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to find and repair the concern for typical home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is taking place to your house.</p>
