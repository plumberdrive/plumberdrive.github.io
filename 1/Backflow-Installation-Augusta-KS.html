<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
