<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
