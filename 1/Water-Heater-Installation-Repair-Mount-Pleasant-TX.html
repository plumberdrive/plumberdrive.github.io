<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working successfully due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to utilize a growing number of detergent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and disinfected during regrowth. Finally, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
