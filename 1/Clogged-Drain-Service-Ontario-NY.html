Gas is also chosen because it can be a green" or clean energy source. This fossil fuel consists of 43 percent less carbon dioxide than an electricity source that is derived from coal.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. But not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>You probably know something about your drains: they take water from your showers, bathtubs, and sinks to a local water treatment center. When drains are working effectively that's really all you need to understand about them, but when something fails, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the proficiency to detect a problem and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as two hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
