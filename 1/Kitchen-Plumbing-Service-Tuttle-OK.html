The key to the technology is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore removing hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
