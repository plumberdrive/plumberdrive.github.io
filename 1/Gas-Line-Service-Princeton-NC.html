Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed effectively (Photo 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>

Gently flex the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Photo 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the outcome of a corroded overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Offer the professionals at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and reduce lost water.</p>
