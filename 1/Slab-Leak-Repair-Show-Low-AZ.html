<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Show Low AZ</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process.

But the reality is that water softening merely removes firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>The most typical technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a process in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another element, typically sodium. Sodium won't cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low salt" by the Fda.</p>
