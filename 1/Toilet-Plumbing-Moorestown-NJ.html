<p>Inspect the house's warm water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated up and offered for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious indications of deterioration, request that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
