The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
