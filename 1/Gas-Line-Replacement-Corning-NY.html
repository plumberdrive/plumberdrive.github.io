<p>Gas is difficult to discover, as it's a colorless, odor free substance. We utilize natural gas in our homes with gas ranges, heaters, and ovens. American homes access natural gas through miles and miles of underground pipelines. Having a natural gas leak from an outdoor pipeline and indoor appliances can take place rapidly and all of a sudden.
