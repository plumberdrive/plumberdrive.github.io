<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Marlboro NJ</h3>
<p>Examine the house's warm water heater You will be seeking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated up and available for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent indications of corrosion, request that a new one be set up.</p>
