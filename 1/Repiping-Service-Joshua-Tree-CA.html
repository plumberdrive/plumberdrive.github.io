Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
