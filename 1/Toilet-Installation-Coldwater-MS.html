<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly when water is hard. Water softening can prevent these negative results. Gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers gas an odor often associated with rotten eggs.

In the bathroom, you might have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink.
