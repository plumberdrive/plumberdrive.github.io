<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
